TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

I love trail running. I love the sense of 
adventure and the adrenaline of climbing   in the mountains. There's an addiction to the 
sense of danger you get, holding on to a chain   rope next to a steep drop or traversing an exposed 
ridge. None of us knew at the start of TDS 2021,   that we were about to see those very real 
dangers exposed to us in such a tragic way.   Of course, the race began like any other. Right, 
here we are in Courmayeur. It's a little bit   different from years before and we're starting in
waves and we're starting in a different location   to normal. This is where you drop your bags. So if 
you've got a halfway bag or a bag that you collect   during the race, that's at Beaufort, that's in 
this section. Then if you want to have a bag right   at the end of the race if you haven't got any way 
to get to your hotel or anything, then you can   drop a bag here and collect it at the end of the 
race. And this is the other side of Mont Blanc. It was a warm afternoon. Race start 
time was 4pm (NOT 6pm) with the faster   runners heading off first. I was in 
the third wave. In the second wave   just ahead was an experienced 
runner from the Czech Republic. He was 15 years younger than me, but we both 
started our ultra running journeys in 2014. And by coincidence, we both finished the 
Transgrancanaria Ultra in 2020. I imagine   he was just as nervous and excited 
as me as we stood on the start line.   145 kilometres of mountains and valleys between 
us and the finish in Chamonix. Welcome to Film My   Run. we're in Courmayeur for the second time, 
trying to complete TDS. 145 kilometres, 9000   metres of elevation gain. We're starting 
in a slightly different place to last time,   but it's still just as hard if not 
harder. Let's see what happens. Here we go guys The race start was as energised as always,   with Eoin Flynn's recognisable voice filling 
the air as we passed under the start gantry. This time my wife and children 
were there to see me off,   but often they're back at home or in a hotel 
thinking of me. My wife says she's always in   a heightened state of anxiety every time I 
take to the trails in a big race like this.   I imagine the family of the Czech runner ahead 
of me had similar feelings to those of my wife.   Knowing your runner is experienced and confident, 
but at the same time nervous that everything   should go as smoothly as it had done so many times 
before. He was a much faster runner than me and   had achieved some impressive podium positions 
in a number of his ultra races. I imagine   him striding confidently up the mountain, 
relishing the beauty of his surroundings.   On fresh legs the first climb out of Courmayeur was 
comfortable in the evening sun. Okay the first aid   station climbed, Checrouit, and we are one hour 
eight minutes in with 700 odd metres climbed.   In general the trails around the 
Mont Blanc massif are runnable.   There are very few sections of technical terrain.   What makes the UTMB event so difficult is 
the amount of elevation, the length and   the steepness of the climbs. Two hours and five 
minutes, top of the first climb. Merci, gratzie. So downhill now to the next aid station.   So this is Lac Combal. No, Lac Combal is 
the next aid station. 2417 metres we are,   above sea level. We've climbed up 1300 
metres and that's 10 kilometres done.   Sun is starting to go in. 
Might get a little cold soon. So this is the second aid station, Lac Combal. 
Loads of people are getting themselves ready   for the night here now. So it's hats on, 
gloves on, coats on and the next climb.   We're just coming to the end of the second 
major climb and we've done 18 kilometres,   and now it's about 10 kilometres downhill 
in a minute. All on kind of gravel path. We’ve just heard thunder. They 
did warn us at the beginning   that there might be a storm tonight or early 
evening, so we're looking out for that.   So we have 16 kilometres to go 
down to Col du Petit Saint-Bernard and we need to be there by half past 
midnight. So it's now half past seven.   Five hours to get down the 
hill. 16 kilometres, 10 miles. All right, so, we are at Col du 
Petit Saint-Bernard which is 35   kilometres. So we have 15 kilometres to 
run down the hill to Bourg-Saint-Maurice.   This aid station closes in two hours, so 
we're well in time. And I've just had soup   and I'm gonna have some bread and cheese. I've 
still got some chocolates and I might get some   coke as well. We are here. Just come to 
the bottom of the descent. So we've now   got Bourg-Saint-Maurice shortly and then we've got 
that massive climb to do, up to Fort de la Platte. So we're at about 47 kilometres here. By now 
the Czech runner was some way ahead of me.   As I was descending from the Col du Petit 
Saint-Bernard, he was already at the top of   the climb out of Bourg-Saint-Maurice near Fort de 
la Platte, around 10 kilometres in front of me. So this is Bourg-Saint-Maurice at 50 
kilometres into the race. Nine hours 14   minutes. Next up is a huge climb. 1500 metre 
climb all the way up to Fort de la Platte. I was nervous because I knew this 
next section was going to be tough.   I am so happy. We've made it 
to Fort de la Platte at 3am.   So, well ahead of cut off. Beautiful fire up 
here and I've got some money, which means I   could buy an Orangina as well, which last year 
I couldn’t. So I am very very happy today.   But my happiness was to be short-lived. Just a 
few kilometres further on I arrived at the most   technical section of the race. I am stood at 60 
kilometres into the race and there has been an   accident further up on the course, blocking 
all the runners, and we've all had a text   message to say the race has been abandoned, 
and we all have to walk…. we've got another   10 kilometres to go back down to 
Bourg-Saint-Maurice and get buses back and   that is the end of the race. And there are people, 
I don't know if you can see the lights up there on   the hill, there are people all the way up there, 
who've got to come all the way back down again. Somebody's been speaking to the Race Directors 
on the phone. The race is definitely cancelled   and we just we just have to turn back and 
go back to go back to Bourg-Saint-Maurice,   which is going to take us another few hours. 
And I have to come back and do this again.   Of course, my disappointment is understandable, 
but looking back it feels incredibly selfish. What   I didn't know at the time was that the accident up 
ahead had been a fatal one. The Czech runner who   had started with the same confidence, excitement 
and nervous anticipation as I had, just a few   hours earlier, had fallen on the most technical 
and dangerous part of the course. A trail runner   doing what he loved, doing the same thing as me, 
was dead. This is a very depressing experience   climbing down here. But it is a beautiful view 
and one that we wouldn't have got otherwise.   At this point all we knew was that there had 
been an accident and the race had been abandoned.   I wasn't aware of the countless runners stranded 
further up, unable to make it back down until   ropes had been put in place. I didn't know 
runners had been turned around because the   rescue helicopter couldn't see to retrieve the 
body, because of the blinding head torches below.   So, finally arrived back at Bourg-Saint-Maurice. 
That was a long, long journey down the hill.   I'm not having a lot of luck with this 
race am I? One DNF and one abandonment.   But there we are. There's not a lot 
I can do about it. The race is over   and I'm now waiting for a bus to take me back 
to Chamonix. Eventually, news started to filter   back about the death of the Czech runner and 
the mood turned to one of somber reflection.   Much of that reflection is still selfish 
of course. It could have been me.   I'm so relieved it wasn't me. 
I hope my wife knows I'm okay.   But it must have been absolutely heartbreaking 
for the family of the Czech runner.   Don't stop running my friend. Don't spend your 
life frozen in fear of what might go wrong,   because life is all about taking risks 
it's the risk-takers who turn their own   lives around or change the world. So I will 
see you on the start line of our next race.
