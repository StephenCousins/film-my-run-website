==================================================

[00:00] yeah i am
[00:02] i am completely wrecked totally my feet
[00:05] are absolutely shot to pieces i haven't
[00:07] taken my shoes off at all for the whole
[00:09] race
[00:10] i dread to think what they look like
[00:13] [Music]
[00:18] there are very few iconic must-do
[00:21] 100-mile races in the uk
[00:23] but the montaigne lakeland 100 is
[00:26] undoubtedly one of them
[00:29] so we're in kitchen
[00:30] uh these people here are checking your
[00:33] number and your id
[00:35] and then they'll write your number on
[00:36] your hand like that
[00:39] and then we go and kit check we get all
[00:41] the stuff in this bag
[00:43] check to make sure it's right
[00:45] despite not reaching a single wainwright
[00:48] peak
[00:49] the race packs over 6000 meters of
[00:52] elevation gain into its 105 mile route
[00:56] from coniston clockwise to buttermere
[00:59] and keswick round ulswater and through
[01:02] ambleside before returning to coniston
[01:12] regardless of its stellar status
[01:14] attracting top runners from around the
[01:16] world the lakeland 100 has a friendly
[01:18] community feel about it
[01:20] the cut-off times are generous making it
[01:22] an accessible and achievable goal for a
[01:25] much greater proportion of the ultra
[01:27] running community
[01:28] welcome
[01:30] to the 2022 montaigne lake 100 welcome
[01:33] to connor stark
[01:37] this was to be my first attempt at the
[01:39] race
[01:40] coming off the back of a good 14-week
[01:43] training block i was feeling confident
[01:45] and hoping to get round in under 30
[01:48] hours
[01:48] i mean it's only 100 miles how hard can
[01:52] it be
[02:28] welcome to film my run
[02:29] this is the lakeland 100 we're in
[02:31] coniston we're going to run 105 miles
[02:34] all around the next district and coming
[02:36] back to coniston hopefully in around
[02:38] about 30 odd hours
[02:41] [Music]
[02:43] [Applause]
[02:48] [Music]
[02:51] climbing the first hill i met laura hi
[02:54] laura tell us how old you are i am 20.
[02:57] and is this your first hundred miler
[02:59] this is my first hundred miler yes but
[03:02] you've done what here the kids race i i
[03:06] have done the legend one when i was 14
[03:08] which is the kids race yeah the kids
[03:10] race
[03:11] i've done
[03:12] the 50 last year
[03:14] in 20
[03:16] well whatever last year was i was 19.
[03:18] yeah um
[03:20] and then i'm entered the hundred this
[03:22] year
[03:24] and you're the first person to do all
[03:26] those three races or at least start all
[03:28] those three races yeah well you know
[03:30] hoping
[03:32] [Music]
[03:38] i've done a few hundreds now and the one
[03:40] thing i've learned is you can't plan for
[03:42] every eventuality
[03:44] all you can do is train and prepare the
[03:46] best you can and then hope nothing
[03:49] unexpected comes along to derail your
[03:51] race
[03:53] two hours and 18 minutes into the
[03:55] lakeland 100
[03:56] we are
[03:58] nearly 10 miles in 15 and a half
[04:00] kilometers or so
[04:02] to the uh
[04:04] race and uh
[04:05] it's fairly easy going at the moment a
[04:08] couple of steep hills
[04:10] it's got a bit
[04:12] boggy at times
[04:14] but nothing too bad
[04:19] but it is going to get dark fairly soon
[04:21] the light feels like it's closing in
[04:23] already
[04:24] there'll be head torches
[04:26] and they're not too distant future
[04:28] [Music]
[04:34] i made it to the second checkpoint just
[04:36] before dark
[04:37] right it's a little bit dark but 23
[04:39] kilometers in
[04:41] two hours 36 minutes this is check point
[04:43] number two at yeah we're 23k so what 14
[04:47] miles 15 miles
[04:49] it was incredibly humid and i found i
[04:52] was drinking a huge amount of water
[04:54] overnight compared to normal i often
[04:57] won't have anything at all for the first
[04:58] 10 miles or so
[05:00] don't suppose you can see all the lights
[05:04] heading up the hill 10 30 at night
[05:11] five hours and nine minutes in
[05:14] yeah 32 kilometers done just about what
[05:17] what's the name of this checkpoint
[05:20] and we're at wasdale head here
[05:26] and i've got hot soup which is
[05:27] absolutely awesome and everyone is
[05:30] dressed it
[05:32] as cat cows cheeks
[05:36] 101 dalmatians why did i not get that
[05:38] thank you rachel yeah my name is thank
[05:40] you
[05:45] we've made it to checkpoint for
[05:46] buttermir
[05:47] this is just over a quarter of the way
[05:50] through and we've done it in about seven
[05:53] and a half seven forty five
[05:56] seven and a half hours let's say
[05:58] and we've had a milkshake chocolate
[06:01] milkshake
[06:03] and i've got a hot dog as well
[06:04] so let's get on our way with that
[06:07] as the night wore on conditions
[06:09] underfoot were beginning to make the
[06:11] going more difficult and then it started
[06:14] to rain
[06:15] right we are nearly 10 hours into the
[06:18] lakeland 100 it's uh all 54 kilometers
[06:22] in
[06:24] and we're having coffee
[06:26] unfortunately it's taking longer to get
[06:28] the coffee than normal because the poor
[06:29] lady was doing it so tight she can't
[06:30] remember what everyone's ordering
[06:32] that's this is caroline who and we've
[06:35] discovered
[06:36] um we beat her out of every aid station
[06:37] but then she passes us on every downhill
[06:40] [Music]
[06:43] right it's quarter past five in the
[06:45] morning
[06:46] and we are now
[06:49] climbing round blencathra
[06:52] 62 kilometers in
[06:56] finally taking the head torches off
[06:59] [Music]
[07:02] i was running with spencer as we hit one
[07:04] of the two virtual checkpoints on the
[07:06] course near long scale fell
[07:09] spencer's just reminded me to tell you
[07:11] i've had a technical problem i only have
[07:14] one pole because the other one won't
[07:15] extend
[07:17] the little silver button won't pop out
[07:21] it's very annoying
[07:27] so we're at blencher aid station
[07:30] um i've got my breakfast toast which is
[07:32] good
[07:33] um
[07:34] it's a bit too warm in here
[07:36] i've been wearing
[07:38] my vest the whole time and it's only now
[07:41] after it's been raining for four hours
[07:43] that i've decided to put my uh
[07:46] rainproof jacket on
[07:47] it's a bit stupid really isn't it but
[07:48] there we are um we're at
[07:52] 68 kilometers in 67 which is about 42
[07:56] miles
[08:00] [Music]
[08:01] i was finding it tough going but at this
[08:03] point i still believed i was on for the
[08:05] sub 30 hour finish
[08:08] i was in good spirits despite my rotting
[08:10] feet beneath me
[08:13] [Music]
[08:19] rainbow
[08:22] [Music]
[08:27] we're nearly at 50 miles
[08:29] my legs are
[08:32] my legs are really done in
[08:34] another 50 miles to go well more than
[08:36] that really
[08:38] we've got to get to dale maine as the
[08:40] next aid station we've just been to an
[08:42] aid station i had some lovely soup
[08:45] and a cheese and pickle sandwich
[08:48] so that was awesome
[08:50] i'd really like to get
[08:52] to exactly halfway which i think is
[08:54] about 83 kilometers
[08:56] i really like to get there
[08:59] by 9 00 a.m
[09:04] 9 a.m would mean halfway in 15 hours and
[09:08] in theory still on for a sub 30 hour
[09:11] finish
[09:12] but in reality i knew i was slowing down
[09:15] despite the much easier terrain between
[09:18] blencathra at 42 miles and dale main at
[09:21] 59 miles
[09:24] so we're just coming into dale maine now
[09:25] which is uh
[09:27] the start of the 50 mile race so these
[09:29] guys are all doing 50 miles
[09:33] [Applause]
[09:39] right so this is where we get our drop
[09:41] bags at dale main
[09:43] perhaps this might have been the moment
[09:44] to take some time to look at my feet and
[09:46] try to minimize any problems for the
[09:48] next 45 miles however i just wanted to
[09:51] get on with it and get out of dale maine
[09:53] before the 50 mile runners started their
[09:55] race right that's me done at delta i'm
[09:58] just talking to the cat don't i'm not
[10:00] made
[10:06] i am done at del main uh i've been very
[10:09] lucky and they've given me some milk
[10:11] just plain milk which was fantastic i've
[10:13] had soup
[10:15] um i've got my drop bag and i've got
[10:17] food and drinks in my drop bag
[10:19] station on the course
[10:21] and apparently this is the best feed
[10:22] station on the course
[10:27] leaving dale maine the sun was out and
[10:29] there was some great support through
[10:31] pulley bridge
[10:32] before we headed back up onto the trails
[10:35] towards howtown taking in the beauty of
[10:38] ul's water
[10:39] [Music]
[10:42] so at the moment we've got all the 50
[10:44] runners who just started at dell maine
[10:47] passing us i thought it'd be a bit
[10:48] demoralizing to have them all passing us
[10:50] but
[10:51] it's uh it's actually quite motivating
[10:52] it's making me run quicker
[10:54] and they all kind of look at your name
[10:56] on the back and they
[10:57] say well done as they pass you hold on
[10:59] guys it's like that guy well done cheers
[11:01] guys
[11:09] thank you
[11:10] so it's quite nice
[11:21] 40 miles to go
[11:25] [Music]
[11:29] right we are 20 hours and 20 minutes in
[11:33] to the lakeland 100 we've done 112
[11:36] kilometers which is around about
[11:39] 64 65 miles something like that
[11:43] and uh what a lovely view
[11:45] we're on the biggest climb of the run
[11:49] um
[11:49] i'm not sure if that's a false summit up
[11:51] there but it doesn't look like we're too
[11:53] far from the top
[11:55] cheers guys these are all the 50 runners
[11:57] coming up here
[11:59] there's a scattering of 100 mile runners
[12:02] just making their way up the hill as
[12:03] well
[12:04] you can tell them because they're slower
[12:06] [Music]
[12:10] right this is mar dale checkpoints um it
[12:13] is raining we've got
[12:16] 45k
[12:18] to go
[12:19] just over a marathon left
[12:21] got a big climb coming up now i am
[12:24] absolutely shattered
[12:26] jeff partridge is here
[12:30] but yeah my legs are
[12:32] really tired my back's aching
[12:35] but
[12:36] i'm just gonna yeah it's always good to
[12:38] have a whinge on camera and then get on
[12:40] with it we will get to the end it'll be
[12:42] absolutely fine
[12:43] but you know you've got just to allow me
[12:45] to moan at you for a little bit
[12:47] [Music]
[12:50] between town and mardale head we'd run
[12:53] beside horse water and i'd found the
[12:55] trail extremely difficult i ran some of
[12:58] this with my friend jeff but he was
[13:00] stronger and faster than me and i had to
[13:03] let him go i found myself losing the
[13:05] mental will to keep pushing but i went
[13:08] on in the rain towards kentner
[13:11] it's raining it's windy
[13:14] got less than a marathon to go now
[13:18] kent near checkpoint served chili pasta
[13:21] and ice cold smoothies which was
[13:23] absolutely superb i'd also bumped into
[13:26] some friends laura jane and joe which
[13:29] gave me a little bit of a boost to keep
[13:31] moving forward
[13:37] [Applause]
[13:42] so that's true this is trout back
[13:47] we're on our way to ambleside
[13:51] thank you
[13:55] i met up with these two who were
[13:57] dragging me along
[13:59] hello
[14:04] and just as day turned into night we
[14:06] made it to ambleside
[14:08] it was great seeing all the support as
[14:10] we ran through the town to the
[14:12] checkpoint
[14:13] jane and joe were moving too quickly for
[14:15] me now and they went on a head after
[14:17] ambleside
[14:18] cheers guys
[14:20] [Applause]
[14:23] so we're in ambleside
[14:26] hi everybody
[14:28] from here the dark trails the
[14:30] intermittent rain and my overall fatigue
[14:33] conspired to prevent me filming anything
[14:35] more out on route
[14:38] so this is the aid station inside
[14:41] ambleside there's loads of people
[14:43] outside
[14:44] but i wanted a coffee so i'd come inside
[14:48] on the whole the aid stations were well
[14:50] stocked i certainly managed on
[14:52] sandwiches pasta and soup and i loved
[14:55] the extras like the hot dogs the
[14:57] smoothies and the cheese toasty i had at
[15:00] tibithweit
[15:01] arguably there could have been more
[15:03] fruit like watermelon and fewer dry
[15:05] biscuits
[15:07] we're on 28 hours
[15:09] and 13 minutes 147 kilometers
[15:14] we've got about 16 miles left 15 miles
[15:18] left to go walk all the way i think i'm
[15:20] just gonna go really slowly and just
[15:22] okay just get it done because i'm so
[15:24] tired
[15:28] so this is the second last aid station
[15:30] on the lakeland 100.
[15:32] we have 15 kilometers to go from here
[15:36] yeah i am
[15:37] i am completely wrecked totally my feet
[15:40] are absolutely shot to pieces i haven't
[15:42] taken my shoes off at all for the whole
[15:44] race
[15:45] i dread to think what they look like
[15:48] it was nice to run with jane and joe for
[15:50] a little while that was good
[15:52] that spurred me along a bit and got me
[15:54] out of the doldrums a little bit because
[15:55] i was feeling sorry for myself
[15:57] and we'll definitely get this run done
[16:01] run
[16:03] it's not
[16:05] probably going to finish at about three
[16:06] o'clock in the morning we've been going
[16:08] for 30 hours and 10 minutes now little
[16:11] did i know that the last 10 miles would
[16:14] take me four and a half more hours
[16:17] i ran much of it with my new friend
[16:19] emily who was finishing her fifth
[16:21] lakeland 100.
[16:29] [Music]
[16:48] oh what did you ask me to do

[17:29] emotional let me tell you that
[17:31] but and this is so this is where if you
[17:33] finish you get your photo taken you get
[17:35] your medal
[17:37] and

[17:50] good atmosphere lots of noise lots of
[17:52] clapping
