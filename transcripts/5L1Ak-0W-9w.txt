==================================================

[00:02] This is the beautiful town of St Peter’s  Port in Guernsey, and it’s the beginning and  
[00:09] end point for the GU36 Guernsey Ultra. A 36  mile race which circumnavigates the island.
[00:15] The race starts here at the Liberation  Monument and heads out of town on to 16  
[00:21] miles of hilly trail, running over the  cliffs to the west of St. Peter’s Port.
[00:27] It was an early start, but the sunrise was  perfect as we headed past the harbour to  
[00:33] race registration for what would be my third GU36.
[00:37] Given the weather forecast over the past  two days it is unbelievable that the sun  
[00:43] is out this morning. We're here at Guernsey  St Peters Port, in front of the beautiful...  
[00:49] what's it called? Liberation Monument. Thank  you! In front of the beautiful Liberation,  
[00:54] how could I forget that... In front of the  beautiful Liberation Monument to start the  
[00:58] Guernsey Ultra the Guernsey 36 miler, which  we've done twice before. I did want to try and  
[01:05] go for a time today, but Victoria's convinced  me to have another jolly with ice cream and  
[01:09] swimming. I don't think there's going to be  much swimming today, but we're going to enjoy  
[01:12] ourselves whatever happens. So come with us  while we run around the island of Guernsey.
[01:20] A little ultra tip for you while I remember.  When you put your race number on just screw it  
[01:26] into a ball, unless there's a chip on the back  of course. Don't do it if there's a chip on the  
[01:29] back. Screw it into a ball and then it'll stop it  flapping around in the wind when you're running.  
[01:33] After registration and the race briefing, around  120 runners including Victoria and our Zwift  
[01:41] friend Clive, headed off for another adventure  on the second largest of the Channel Islands.
[01:49] The first mile takes runners through  the town, alongside the harbour and  
[01:53] past the impressive castle, which I'd  filmed in the sunshine the day before.  
[01:58] Then, leaving St Peters Port, we began climbing up  through the trees. We're a couple of kilometres  
[02:05] in. What we feared, has started. The rain has  started. But we are under tree cover at the  
[02:11] moment which is quite nice. Before we get out in  the rain, what was your name again? Luke Ballard,  
[02:15] hello. Hello Luke. From Dorset. First ultra today?  First ever run with a number on, official run.
[02:23] For the Alzheimer's Society. So he's running for  the Alzheimer's Society. Wish Luke a bit of luck  
[02:30] to get around today in his first ever race. For  the first 16 miles you're running on what's known  
[02:37] as the cliff section. Dipping down into valleys  and small coves with pristine beaches, before  
[02:44] climbing multiple steps to get up and out again.  Right this is Fermain Bay. This is Fermain Tower.  
[02:53] Three and a half kilometres in, in 27 minutes.  
[02:57] It is without doubt one of the most visually  pleasing races you will ever do. The trails  
[03:03] are narrow and winding, without ever being too  technically demanding. The views are reminiscent  
[03:09] of the Cornish coast. The cliffs are no less  impressive and the flora is lush and colourful.  
[03:17] The route is way marked and mostly easy to  navigate. The red flags seen here actually  
[03:23] denote nests of rare Black-backed Meadow  Ants, which is a near-threatened species  
[03:29] according to the International Union for  Conservation of Nature. First checkpoint,  
[03:36] thank you. So that's one hour 55  minutes. So I was hoping to get to  
[03:42] the first checkpoint in about two  hours, so that's what we've done.  
[03:47] There is no let up in the steps through the first  section of the race and it's important to manage  
[03:53] your effort here, so you're not completely  done by the time you reach the flat section.  
[03:58] You will climb almost the entire 1300 metres of  race elevation in the first 26 kilometres. Two  
[04:07] hours 12 minutes and we are 15 kilometres in.  How are you feeling? Okay it's probably a bit  
[04:17] of a harder effort than I would like it to be, but  to be fair I've not done much training in the last  
[04:22] four weeks. We're 17 kilometres in, so only 40K to  go. Less than a marathon left. Another similarity  
[04:32] between the Guernsey and Cornish coastlines is the  palpable sense of history. In Cornwall, it's the  
[04:39] ruined tin mines which tell a story. Here, it's the  incredibly well preserved German gun emplacements.  
[04:46] There are some imposing structures  positioned along the southern coastline.
[04:50] Don, you're local yea? Yes. Did  you say this is your first ultra?  
[04:57] This is my first ultra, yes. How are you finding  it? So far, good. I mean present company included  
[05:03] it's nice having the people to chat to and yeah  so far feeling all right. Good stuff. Let's see.  
[05:11] Yeah, so we're not far away now from the end of  the cliff section. About 4K to go, three and a  
[05:17] half K to go, to the end of the cliffs. And then  it's 20 miles of flatness which, as we all know,  
[05:24] isn't necessarily a good thing. As you can  hear from the people I've talked to so far,  
[05:30] many runners use the GU36 as a superb step up from  marathon distance for their introduction to ultra  
[05:37] running. Or even as a first trail race. Every year  I film this canon and this year it's been painted!
[05:46] In the final couple of miles of the cliff section  the trail becomes somewhat flatter and the end is  
[05:52] marked, first by a lighthouse off the coast, and  then by the aid station, where you can pick up  
[05:57] your drop bag and get ready for 20 miles of flat  running. So this is what an aid station should be.  
[06:05] You've got pretty much everything you could want.  The aid station itself is really well stocked with  
[06:11] sweet and savoury foods and the volunteers are  always lovely. For the next 15 miles you will  
[06:18] run on road, coast path, soft grass and dry  sand, through small towns and next to picture  
[06:25] perfect bays. You can stop for ice cream or even  go for a swim if the tide is in. How many ultra  
[06:32] races have you done? This is my very first one.  Wow, fantastic! So a nice one to start off with.  
[06:38] Beautiful yes. As with the cliff section, it's  important to manage your pace again here. You  
[06:45] still have 20 miles to go, so try to relax into an  energy efficient rhythm. Right this is Jim. Jim's  
[06:54] another one of those people who blames me for him  entering this race! Absolutely, it's all his fault!
[07:01] Right we've got 9k to go. We're all suffering a  little bit. My back's aching quite a lot today.  
[07:08] But we'll get this done.
[07:09] Really having to dig deep. Do  you just want it to be over? Yup.
[07:17] 51 kilometres in, in seven hours  and you can see we now have rounded  
[07:23] the whole island of Guernsey. We've just  got to head into St Peter's Port. Over  
[07:29] there is the island of Herm and Sark and  just behind Sark, in the distance, is Jersey.  
[07:36] By this point Victoria was starting to suffer  and I could see her digging deep into her mental  
[07:42] reserves to get the job done. We've all been to  dark places on our long runs. 
[07:47] Just really struggling. But with experience  
[07:50] we learn that we can come out the other side,  and that by doing so, reaching the finish is made  
[07:55] all the more special. Less than three kilometres  to go now. Victoria is trying her best to try  
[08:02] and get under her previous time on this course.  She's pushing as hard as she can. She's so tired  
[08:08] and the sun has now come out so it's a glorious  day, but it's warm, sapping everybody's energy.
[08:16] Really struggling. Yea. Having  to keep it together mentally. Okay 
[08:23] Kilometre to go mate, just walk it in. Well  
[08:25] done. You'll get there you'll get  there in the next 10 minutes mate
[08:32] 1km to go. Struggling with heat stroke now. It has  been it's been cloudy, but really muggy all day.  
[08:40] It had been a tough last five miles for everyone.  
[08:44] So here we come into the finish. Touching  the Liberation Monument to finish.
[08:55] Cheers buddy. Lovely to  meet you. Good job and you.
[09:01] Thank you very much. Second time? Third  time. So the winner was Tian Erwee,  
[09:06] who finished in four hours and  12 minutes. Beat his own course  
[09:12] record. Clive here finished in 6:10,  which is awesome. And we've come in,  
[09:17] Victoria has beaten her previous time. So last  time she got 7:57, so beat it by 11 minutes today.
[09:25] Well done Vic. Thank you. I'm glad that's over!  Yea, you suffered the last 10 miles didn't you?  
[09:32] Well done buddy. And he's finished.  That's it from Guernsey and the GU36.  
[09:40] Victoria finished beating last year's time by  11 minutes. Not last year's time, 2019's time,  
[09:46] by 11 minutes. We've had a lovely day out  everyone's enjoyed themselves. Everyone's  
[09:50] getting their medals and all the extra aid  station food is being given away free of charge,  
[09:55] so we've scrammed loads of it. Yeah  we've had a great time so we'll see  
[10:00] you again for another Film My Run for another  crazy adventure next time. Take care bye-bye.
