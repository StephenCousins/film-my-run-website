can do it I mean there's a dual cut off if you like so if you get in seven and a half hours you get a medal and a t-shirt if you get him without nine hours then you get a t-shirt but no medal but it's also good for people who may be trained for other races or they're looking to step up to a longer race that extends into the darkness and a lot of running trail running in the dark it's safe race for doing that there's lots of race support you're never really far from civilization even though you actually feel like you know so it's good for that it's easy for people living in the UK is it easy to get to Guernsey yes it's there's lots of flights not so many boats at this time of year it's not so easy as in May when the g36 is on but yeah there's a lot pretty of options of flights some people choose to come yeah I mean I flew in four o'clock yesterday sat in a cafe and then raced at twelve and I'm flying back today so I haven't even needed a hotel yeah so makes it fairly cheap yeah yeah but it's goods means you get the you don't get the full beauty of the online dreams youth it's because it's dark you do get this sense of isolation so it's a particular kind of race isn't it that you you need a challenge you're looking to step up you want to do some night running you've maybe got another race coming up that has night running in it and you need to practice or you need to practice on the cliffs or you just want to do something completely different the adventure of it yeah absolutely and I can't stress the safety as well this you get the feeling of isolation but you're never actually really far from civilization and we have motorized sweeper to go around the extremely safe ins our environment if you might be nervous night running in other locations you don't need to be nervous in Guernsey it's perfectly safe so if you've never been to Guernsey before why not and maybe your new talks running why not come and do gu 36 if you love it which you will come and do Gunn 31

[11:02] and I'm flying back today so I haven't
[11:04] even needed a hotel yeah so makes it
[11:07] fairly cheap yeah yeah but it's goods
[11:10] means you get the you don't get the full
[11:13] beauty of the online dreams youth it's
[11:15] because it's dark you do get this sense
[11:18] of isolation so it's a particular kind
[11:21] of race isn't it that you you need a
[11:24] challenge you're looking to step up you
[11:28] want to do some night running you've
[11:29] maybe got another race coming up that
[11:31] has night running in it and you need to
[11:33] practice or you need to practice on the
[11:34] cliffs or you just want to do something
[11:36] completely different
[11:38] the adventure of it yeah absolutely and
[11:40] I can't stress the safety as well this
[11:44] you get the feeling of isolation but
[11:47] you're never actually really far from
[11:48] civilization and we have motorized
[11:50] sweeper to go around the extremely safe
[11:52] ins our environment if you might be
[11:55] nervous night running in other locations
[11:58] you don't need to be nervous in Guernsey
[12:00] it's perfectly safe so if you've never
[12:02] been to Guernsey before why not and
[12:04] maybe your new talks running why not
[12:06] come and do gu 36 if you love it which
[12:09] you will come and do Gunn 31 and have a
[12:13] real challenge thanks Peter thank you
