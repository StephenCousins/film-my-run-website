[00:55] yesterday I have no idea how I convinced
[00:58] my body to start moving again on day
[01:01] four of the cape wrath Ultra but somehow
[01:04] I managed to get going and we were
[01:07] straight into a climb out of the midfest
[01:10] that was akna shelak of course I made
[01:14] sure to take things very easy for the
[01:17] first few kilometers as I had been doing
[01:19] for the last couple of days but it
[01:22] wasn't long before I caught up with tent
[01:25] mate Jay who had stayed ahead of me for
[01:28] the whole of day three
[01:30] so uh day four yeah come on then oh we
[01:34] just climbed out of camp we came over
[01:37] and down that mountain yesterday we
[01:38] climbed over that mountain in the
[01:39] distance I know it was awful but that's

[02:10] it a lot easier 8 kilm in just at the
[02:15] top of the first climb so we've climbed
[02:18] about 5 600
[02:20] M and 1 hour 42

[02:27] minutes I mean obviously my my legs are
[02:30] really tired but in myself I feel so
[02:35] much better than I did
[02:37] yesterday after the initial climb out of
[02:39] Camp the ground had leveled off somewhat
[02:43] and I'd been able to run a good section
[02:45] of the course before starting the climb
[02:48] up to the
[02:50] pass admiring the incredible scenery
[02:53] from the top I felt very happy just to
[02:56] be moving and the cooler temperatures
[02:59] were definitely
[03:02] helping very Rocky descent here on the
[03:06] first

[05:44] [Laughter]
[05:45] well James had unfortunately been timed
[05:49] out of the main race on day three so was
[05:53] now part of the cape wrath Explorer
[05:56] where Runners can choose to do shorter
[05:58] distances each day day as
[06:01] non-competitive
[06:02] participants by now I was really
[06:05] starting to enjoy myself my legs felt
[06:08] fine and the landscape was
[06:11] immense amazing scenery here isn't it
[06:15] very Rock strewn path so it's much
[06:18] slower to go along and uh Fernando from
[06:22] Portugal just passed me and he said are
[06:24] you not
[06:26] cold and I noticed he's got his rain
[06:28] jacket on then I noticed there's quite a
[06:30] few other people wearing their base
[06:32] layer or their rain jacket and I'm
[06:35] thinking well I'm not cold this is like
[06:37] a a summer's day hi guys
[06:41] hi
[06:43] hey it's like a Blustery Day on the
[06:47] North Yorkshire Ms or something this
[06:49] isn't
[06:51] cold but I guess it can change quickly
[06:54] and you always need to be careful and
[06:56] aware but I've got everything I need in
[06:58] my backpack if I do get cold I can
[07:00] easily quickly put it on but I'm
[07:02] definitely not not cold at the moment
[07:04] it's blowing but it's not freezing cold
[07:07] at all have I gone on about how not cold
[07:11] it

[09:45] Fair flew down the last Hill to camp at
[09:49] kinl full of
[09:51] beans despite the change in the weather
