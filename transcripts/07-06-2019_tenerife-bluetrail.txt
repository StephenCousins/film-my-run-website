[00:13] [Music]
[00:29] [Music]
[00:37] [Music]
[00:52] [Music]
[01:05] anyway
[01:10] so the Army is the start line
[01:15] 100
[01:17] [Music]
[02:12] [Music]
[02:22] [Applause]
[02:26] 500 meters into the race and we're just
[02:29] at a standstill trying to get through
[02:31] bottleneck here
[02:46] [Applause]
[02:51] [Music]
[02:51] [Applause]
[02:55] so here we are at the first aid station
[02:59] [Music]
[03:06] [Music]
[03:09] okay mister carry on
[03:13] [Music]
[03:17] eleven and a half kilometers into the
[03:20] blue trail and we are climbing for about
[03:25] eight hundred nine hundred meters up now
[03:28] you can see the town down there it's an
[03:32] amazing view of lights all the way at
[03:35] the top absolutely incredible
[03:39] [Music]
[04:03] okay just run through the forest there's
[04:08] been quite a bit of kind of level or
[04:10] downhill running at the moment and we've
[04:13] climbed about 1500 meters
[04:17] [Music]
[04:22] so this is a station number three at 21
[04:27] kilometers okay so three hours 39 nights
[04:30] and the cutoff is 4 hours 15 minutes so
[04:33] that's quite good and we've got ten and
[04:35] a half kilometers to the next to the
[04:38] next stop
[04:40] [Music]
[04:43] so this is the checkpoint act 31
[04:46] kilometers nearly 20 miles we've climbed
[04:50] over 2,000 meters so about a third of
[04:54] the climbing that we've got to do it's
[04:57] about five kilometers to the next aid
[04:59] station and then 12 to the next after
[05:03] that and then it's a really big steep
[05:06] climb all the way to the top
[05:10] [Music]
[05:16] it's a real mixture of gullible grand
[05:20] but also really rocky difficult volcanic
[05:25] terrain
[05:27] [Music]
[05:33] okay I've been ready for just under
[05:35] seven hours and done 35 and a half
[05:40] kilometers it's getting light now
[05:43] definitely getting light this aid
[05:45] station and then one more before the
[05:48] climb to the top so there's still some
[05:51] work to do still some work today over
[05:55] 20k still to go to the top 38 kilometers
[06:03] seven hours 26 minutes it's light we've
[06:11] made it through the night time let's
[06:12] hope I don't have to put head torch on
[06:13] again later on
[06:17] [Music]
[06:22] [Music]
[06:34] 3000 meters climbed now
[06:44] [Music]
[07:19] so we've arrived yet quite pretty little
[07:23] church backing on to tale a mountain
[07:28] volcano and this is the final aid
[07:31] station before we head up there 48 and a
[07:35] half kilometers and now we're doing okay
[07:38] I feel I feel obviously I feel tired
[07:41] because it's such a lot of climbing but
[07:44] relative to CCC
[07:46] and trans volcania I'm actually doing
[07:48] all right
[08:00] [Music]
[08:05] okay okay it's high tire fire I am
[08:12] fatigued eh okay so we've done 54
[08:18] kilometers now as far as I understand it
[08:23] the top of there at the top of today is
[08:27] 58 kilometers so we've got four
[08:30] kilometers to go to the top it is really
[08:35] hard it is very hot although there is a
[08:39] bit of a cool breeze because we're so
[08:41] high up so that's one saving grace I'm
[08:46] worried about my water because I've got
[08:47] a lot of water or coke left so I'm
[08:51] trying to conserve that and because of
[08:53] that I'm parched as well and it's a
[08:56] barren landscape a lot of it is this
[08:59] sandy stuff here and there a lot of it
[09:00] is just volcanic rocks boulders to climb
[09:04] over so they get honest most 4k to go to
[09:11] the aid station at the top and it's
[09:14] taken me 11 hours and 19 minutes so far
[09:28] [Music]
[09:40] [Music]
[09:47] just about a one-kilometer to go to the
[09:51] top and to the aid station but
[09:52] everybody's running out of water it's so
[09:54] hot we're all parched so very amazingly
[09:57] some well obviously the race directors
[10:00] left loads of water down here for us
[10:02] which is an absolute godsend
[10:04] unbelievable
[10:09] [Music]
[10:13] this is the top of the climb and he
[10:19] liveth and we did it well done and you
[10:23] can see for miles right I'm so dizzy and
[10:34] tired with the altitude so with 3,500
[10:40] metres above sea level here
[10:44] [Music]
[10:53] okay I've literally had 10 minutes rest
[10:56] in there - tea threw up massively which
[11:02] was awesome and now we've got 13
[11:06] kilometers to go to the next day station
[11:08] we're all very tired
[11:15] [Music]
[11:24] era for me didn't bring my watch to
[11:28] charge it with me
[11:30] so Mike what you died so I'm now relying
[11:33] on other people to tell me how fast to
[11:35] go to the next aid station and what the
[11:37] time is in the race
[11:39] [Music]
[12:19] so we are at seventy two and a half
[12:22] kilometers recibo Kamado and we have
[12:27] another big descent to come and then
[12:30] we've got that nasty climb
[12:32] [Music]
[12:37] right in the threads now I could
[12:39] probably set them better actually
[12:44] I won't be needing them anymore
[12:47] [Music]
[13:07] this dissent has gone on far too long
[13:08] now my leg honey my cords are absolutely
[13:14] [Music]
[13:23] so look we are here and we've got big
[13:31] 500 meter
[13:32] at least 500 meter climb now and then
[13:38] it's down to the finish
[13:46] so I've just done the 500 meter climb up
[13:50] through the forest back touching the
[13:52] clouds again where that high so now it's
[13:56] downhill to the next aid station that
[14:04] was so hard
[14:05] it was just never-ending and then
[14:12] hopefully back onto the beach to the
[14:15] finish line and that there is what we
[14:18] just climbed up all the way to the top
[14:20] of that from down there
[14:26] do you remember my first trans volcania
[14:28] video where I was walking down the
[14:30] street backwards well it's come to that
[14:32] again we're going backwards and it I
[14:34] think it's quicker
[14:39] still got 9k to go
[14:49] [Music]
[14:51] eight K to go
[14:54] [Music]
[15:05] there it is
[15:09] I'm gonna make it before the Sun Goes
[15:11] Down the ISE
[15:39] [Music]
[16:16] [Music]
[16:25] let's out
[16:31] [Music]
[17:06] you
