==================================================

[00:00] Manchester Marathon 2025, let’s go get it.  Trying to stick to 4:30 pace. 
[00:04] Getting warm. Been struggling since the start. 
[00:07] Na, come on Dad, come on!  Got nothing. Got no motivation, got no desire.  
[00:11] So let’s get running again   Dad! Dad! 
[00:22] I don't know about you, but if I'm going to have  the perfect run, everything needs to have fallen  
[00:27] into place. Training, fitness, weather. But most  of all, you need to truly believe you can do it.
[00:35] So we've arrived at the home of the worst  team in the Premier League. Despite some  
[00:41] good final training sessions and positive  race predictions from Strava and Garmin,  
[00:46] I arrived in Manchester worrying about the  heat and not really believing in myself.  
[00:53] Two years ago I went out at kamikaze pace at  this race and scraped in just under three hours.
[00:59] It's going to be a lot more conservative  today. It's going to be really hot and  
[01:04] I'm not feeling super confident,  
[01:06] I have to say today. So we're just going to  start out really slowly and see what happens.
[01:10] Manchester Marathon, 2025. Let's go get it. Two  years before, I had felt totally invincible.
[01:18] And I started Manchester Marathon in 2023  knowing I was fitter than I'd ever been.  
[01:24] When I crossed the start line this year, I was far  less convinced of my ability. Alright, let's go.
[01:31] Let's do this.  
[01:46] The crowds were out in force on a beautiful  day this year and I had two of my children  
[01:51] with me supporting. They managed to turn  the camera on just in time to capture me  
[01:57] as I set off along Bridgewater Way  and then again at around mile 2.
[02:10] I had decided only to film every 5 km or so to  allow me to concentrate on the run. 22 minutes  
[02:19] and 10 seconds, 5 kilometres in. Trying to  stick to 4:30 pace, but we'll see how it goes.
[02:28] Even running at 4 minutes 30 per km,  which should be fairly comfortable for me,  
[02:34] I felt sluggish from the outset.  Go on, Dad. Go on, Stephen.
[02:38] And before long, it was apparent that the weather  wasn't going to make things any easier. 10K done.
[02:45] 44 minutes and 30 seconds or so. Still  not feeling confident getting warm. By  
[02:58] nine miles in, I think I'd already given  up and was beginning to drop off the pace.
[03:04] The goal had been 3 hours 10 minutes or  under. And if you're already feeling the  
[03:09] pace less than an hour in, you  know you're in trouble. 1:07.
[03:15] 1 hour, 7 minutes, 15k. I honestly think it's  not my day. Just been struggling from the start.
[03:26] It's really hard to keep up the pace. Just no  confidence today. 20 kilometres in one hour.
[03:48] Just under 31 minutes. I've slowed  significantly. Just got to get in now.
[04:00] Just gotta salvage what I can. Do the best  I can. It's not going to be pretty though.
[04:07] I kept adjusting my expectations as the race  unfolded and my pace kept dropping. At least at  
[04:13] this stage, I was still running. I'd already seen  people walking or sitting by the side of the road,  
[04:20] but all those gradual inclines  over the railway and canal bridges  
[04:24] and that stupid hill in Altrincham  were beginning to take their toll.
[04:29] Despite this, I went through halfway,  
[04:31] having only lost around 90 seconds off my  goal pace. There we are. That's halfway.
[04:38] 1:36:28. So I think we're looking  at 1:25, the way I've slowed down.
[04:49] I'm just going to try and get in under 1:30.  However, over the next five kilometres,  
[04:55] I really hit a wall and things deteriorated  significantly. 25 kilometres done. One hour,  
[05:02] 55 minutes. I'm gonna stop and drink some water.
[05:08] I'm screwed. Just not today. Not today.
[05:17] Right, I've tipped a load of water over myself.  We are 1 hour, 58 minutes in. Just over 25k.
[05:26] 25.4. So let's get running  again. Just gotta enjoy it now.
[05:38] That's all that's left. It's a beautiful day  heading back towards Manchester city centre.  
[05:45] My boys were there to meet me in Sale.
[05:48] Stephen. Dad. Dad.
[05:54] He's got us. Got the Red Bull. No, come  on, Dad, come on. You got this? Yeah,  
[06:03] I'll finish, but I'm not. I can't get the time.
[06:05] Yeah. What the heck is that on  your arm? What? Are you sure? Yeah.
[06:12] I'm screwed. You'll do it. I mean, it's hot.
[06:14] It is hot. What happened? Just. I  got to 15 and I could feel myself  
[06:20] slowing down. I just can't keep up  the pace. So I'll just jog it in.
[06:25] You got me to the end of my  Centurion 100. You can do this
[06:27] Oh, bless you. You can do this. I'll  finish. You're amazing. Thank you.
[06:32] Cheers, buddy. Oh, right. Okay.
[06:39] So when it's not your day, it's not your day.  But, you know, it's about mindset, isn't it? So I  
[06:47] started this run feeling a bit negative about it,  and that's how it's turned out. But look, mile 18.
[06:53] We'll get to the end. Right see ya. See ya  Dad. 30 kilometres. 2 hours, 24 minutes.
[07:14] There are some lonely, dark moments when  you're capitulating in the back end of a  
[07:19] marathon and no amount of crowd  support can help. All you can do  
[07:23] is keep placing one foot in front of  the other, knowing that however much  
[07:27] you walk the finish line will eventually  appear. 2 hours, 35 minutes for 20 miles.
[07:40] A massive thank you, by the way, to everyone who  shouted out to me on course and those who came  
[07:45] up to say hi. I really appreciate it it and I  hope you all had a great day. Don't forget to  
[07:51] subscribe and most importantly of all, watch to  the end of the video to see me cross that line.
[07:57] 2 hours 53 for 35k 7k to go. Completely wrecked.  
[08:09] The final 10km wasn't even a battle between body  and mind as both were in full agreement that I  
[08:16] could walk as much as I wanted. Let's avoid a  heart attack at all costs and let's not be in the  
[08:22] least bit concerned about time anymore. Hundreds  of runners, some of them having a great day,  
[08:30] others dealing with their own internal demons,  silently overtook me in those last miles.
[08:38] I felt the pressure to run through the  pockets of crowd support, but slowed to  
[08:43] a walk again the minute I turned back onto  the quiet residential streets. 5K to go.  
[09:01] 3 hours 5 minutes 50 seconds.
[09:17] Got nothing. Got no motivation.  Got no desire. Got no energy.
[09:25] With a couple of miles to go, we turned off  Chorlton Road and onto Stretford Road towards  
[09:31] towards the Hulme Arch Bridge which opened in  1997 as part of Manchester's urban renewal. 40K.
[09:43] 3 hours 26 minutes. Final Drink Station coming  up. I'll attribute some of my slowdown in this  
[09:50] race to stomach issues, probably heat  induced. I tried to stay hydrated,  
[09:56] but taking on water just seemed to make me  feel even more bloated and uncomfortable.
[10:01] I ended up tipping most bottles  over my head. With a mile to go,  
[10:06] crowd support seemed a little thin on the ground  until we finally turned onto Oxford Road. About  
[10:13] 400 meters to go. My wife often tells me  that supporting is harder than running and  
[10:18] getting your runner to hear and see you  as they pass can be an impossible task.
[10:23] Nowhere was this more evident than in the  final few meters of Manchester Marathon.  
[10:28] My youngest son is clearly screaming  at me, but I'm completely oblivious.
[11:12] The finish line was in a different  place this year than when I ran it in  
[11:15] 2023 and it certainly gave the run in  a wider, more big city marathon feel.
[11:21] And if I'd been caning it to try and achieve  a PB or a Good for Age, it might have felt a  
[11:27] little more iconic. As it was, I was glad just  to make it to the end without collapsing like  
[11:34] numerous others I'd seen. So that was 3 hours  40 minutes, my slowest marathon for years.
[11:46] I mean I could bang out loads of excuses for you.  
[11:51] Not gonna bother, you know, at the  end of the day, just didn't have it.
[11:56] It was very hot. Well, there's an excuse.  It was hot, but wasn't trained enough.
[12:02] Heavy legs. Really tired. From  about 15k, I was really tired.
[12:09] Just one of the hardest marathons I've  done for ages, that was. But look,  
[12:21] I think a lot of people found it tough today.
[12:24] That was without doubt the worst marathon  performance I have done in years. And it was  
[12:33] the hardest one for a long, long time. Just hot,  no energy, no motivation, lacking in confidence.
[12:42] Just awful. An awful marathon.  But, you know, these things happen,  
[12:46] and they can't be sunshine and roses  every single time you run a marathon.
[12:52] Sometimes they're really awful  and they're really tough,  
[12:55] and that was one of them. But  look, I finished. I got my medal.
[12:59] I've done my second Manchester Marathon, and  let's just take that. So from Manchester,  
[13:08] from a really warm and sunny Manchester  Marathon, 2025. Thank you very much for watching.
[13:14] If you'd like to watch a rather more successful  Manchester Marathon, click that link right there.  
[13:20] That'll show you my 2023 Manchester Marathon,  which was a little faster and a little more  
[13:27] enjoyable. Until then, until next time, take  care, and I'll see you on the start line.
[13:32] Bye.
