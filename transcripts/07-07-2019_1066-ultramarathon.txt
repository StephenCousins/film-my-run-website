[Music] [Music] followed by starlets a hardship welcome to fill my room this is the [Music] [Music] so within within half a mile or less than half a mile we're on the Thames path and we're now following the Thames path for the next 50 K besides the Parliament over the river and London I just ahead about 40k into the 1066 100 miler [Music] you know I never thought I'd run 109 ultra fast the London Eye what our force it into the year 1066 Thunder milah they've supported Cathedral there's the Millennium Bridge and hit the Tate Gallery and we still run along the temple path ten miles junk [Music] so tower bridge their crossroads the Tower of London [Music] my cricket [Music] father let's cross the great to just pour others [Music] thank you buddy hi oh that was lucky okay officially this is 15 miles but most of us have done about 17 miles to get here because we went all over the place well I have anyway we're in Millwall and I've done this in two hours and 50 minutes so it's like 20 miles to the next checkpoint so no doubt we'll be stopping at Costa and Waitrose Sainsbury's and choruses are near Oh on the way and Pizza Hut maybe yeah this is a Greenwich foot tunnel and it goes all the way up to the tenth so going from the north bank in all to the South Bank presumably that's coronation [Music] [Music] that's right Columbus is it device [Music] so we're in Dartford about 40 miles in I am absolutely naked I am its I mean it's not that hot it's not honesty it's about 22 degrees 70 Fahrenheit something like that it's not it's not burning hot but it's just hot enough to make me wilt and I'm at that stage where my stomach is feeling pretty horrible I can't eat any food we've just passed a checkpoint second checkpoint to Dartford in the little church and I just looked at the food I couldn't stomach any of it had a couple of grapes that even that made me feel sick I've bought myself a coffee I've managed to have a couple of pints of milk from various shops since the previous checkpoint but I'm walking an awful lot now I did catch up with Richard and and Jay at one point and then I stopped at a shop and they went on and I hadn't seen him since and I've walked an awful lot but 7 hours 50 minutes 62 kilometers so 40 miles and I'm just gonna charge him a watch and then I'll get on my way but I'm gonna be walking for a bit more I think nice little place to stop though for a minute [Music] [Music] how's it to the 1060 600-mile ultra and now turned about 70 kilometers although actually in reality that's probably less than that and in terms of the route [Music] it's about 6 o'clock in the evening and it's finally starting to cool down a bit which means I'm feeling a bit better and I'm starting to run a bit now not fast but at least I'm running [Music] [Music] so we are about well I've done 50 miles but that doesn't mean we're halfway by any means because there's a lot of extra mileage in there and the whole run is at least 104 so still a way to go yes 37 kilometres to go 23 miles will be going for 20 hours and about 25 minutes it's been the most bizarre hundred mile race there's a really horrible bit through Dartford and areas where there's fly-tipping and rubbish everywhere and it's just a horrible place to run through it's been a lot of tarmac so kind tough on your feet to run on tarmac and then there's been an awful lot of overgrown pathway it's been weird and given the elevation of this ultra which is only about 1,600 700 meters you know I'd expect to do this in 24 hours it's gonna take 27 it's been really really hard there's been loads of walking I'm lucky if I'm covering a kilometer in ten minutes but this is what we do it for it's all good fun to us go we've done them the distance so far in 24 hours almost a hundred miles and there it is boudin castle [Music] [Music] have I seriously got to try and get through that that's not happening is it [Music] people chasing me we've got six kilometers to go for miles [Music] [Music] [Music] so this commences finish now see what it needs to go and it's been served it's not luggage [Music] oh this this grass up to here there's stinging nettles and and thorn bushes at eye level and base level with a path this right sometimes you don't even know if it's the right path even though it says still on you the only I went right through the middle of a bunch of stinging nettles through one of the vineyards because I couldn't work out which way around the vineyard it was so she went right through the bloody middle of it so here I am in front of the famous Battle Abbey site of the Battle of Hastings I always think is really weird how they managed to fight in a place called battle anyway I finished the 1066 100-mile ultra in 26 hours 46 minutes that was really really hard work but I came in 10th place so that shows that it was hard for everyone so that's it from battle here in East Sussex join me again for another marathon another ultra another crazy adventure this one has been a crazy adventure let me tell you next time take care you

[03:54] Millwall and I've done this in two hours
[03:57] and 50 minutes so it's like 20 miles to
[04:00] the next checkpoint so no doubt we'll be
[04:02] stopping at Costa and Waitrose
[04:04] Sainsbury's and choruses are near Oh on
[04:08] the way and Pizza Hut maybe yeah
[04:13] this is a Greenwich foot tunnel and it
[04:17] goes all the way up to the tenth so
[04:20] going from the north bank in all to the
[04:25] South Bank presumably that's coronation
[04:29] [Music]
[04:36] [Music]
[04:42] that's right Columbus is it device
[04:50] [Music]
[04:58] so we're in Dartford about 40 miles in I
[05:06] am absolutely naked
[05:09] I am its I mean it's not that hot
[05:13] it's not honesty it's about 22 degrees
[05:16] 70 Fahrenheit something like that it's
[05:20] not it's not burning hot but it's just
[05:22] hot enough to make me wilt and I'm at
[05:27] that stage where my stomach is feeling
[05:29] pretty horrible I can't eat any food
[05:32] we've just passed a checkpoint second
[05:34] checkpoint to Dartford in the little
[05:36] church and I just looked at the food I
[05:40] couldn't stomach any of it had a couple
[05:42] of grapes that even that made me feel
[05:44] sick I've bought myself a coffee I've
[05:47] managed to have a couple of pints of
[05:49] milk from various shops since the
[05:53] previous checkpoint but I'm walking an
[05:56] awful lot now I did catch up with
[05:59] Richard and and Jay at one point and
[06:01] then I stopped at a shop and they went
[06:04] on and I hadn't seen him since and I've
[06:06] walked an awful lot but 7 hours 50
[06:09] minutes 62 kilometers so 40 miles and
[06:16] I'm just gonna charge him a watch and
[06:18] then I'll get on my way but I'm gonna be
[06:22] walking for a bit more I think nice
[06:24] little place to stop though for a minute
[06:26] [Music]
[06:35] [Music]
[06:42] how's it to the 1060 600-mile ultra and
[06:47] now turned about 70 kilometers although
[06:50] actually in reality that's probably less
[06:52] than that and in terms of the route
[06:57] [Music]
[07:01] it's about 6 o'clock in the evening and
[07:04] it's finally starting to cool down a bit
[07:07] which means I'm feeling a bit better and
[07:10] I'm starting to run a bit now not fast
[07:14] but at least I'm running
[07:20] [Music]
[07:31] [Music]
[07:53] so we are about well I've done 50 miles
[07:56] but that doesn't mean we're halfway by
[08:00] any means because there's a lot of extra
[08:03] mileage in there and the whole run is at
[08:07] least 104 so still a way to go yes 37
[08:59] kilometres to go 23 miles will be going
[09:03] for 20 hours and about 25 minutes it's
[09:06] been the most bizarre hundred mile race
[09:10] there's a really horrible bit through
[09:14] Dartford and areas where there's
[09:17] fly-tipping and rubbish everywhere and
[09:21] it's just a horrible place to run
[09:24] through it's been a lot of tarmac so
[09:27] kind tough on your feet to run on tarmac
[09:30] and then there's been an awful lot of
[09:34] overgrown pathway it's been weird and
[09:39] given the elevation of this ultra which
[09:43] is only about 1,600
[09:47] 700 meters you know I'd expect to do
[09:50] this in 24 hours
[09:51] it's gonna take 27 it's been really
[09:55] really hard there's been loads of
[09:57] walking I'm lucky if I'm covering a
[10:00] kilometer in ten minutes but this is
[10:04] what we do it for it's all good fun to
[10:22] us go we've done them the distance so
[10:26] far in 24 hours almost a hundred miles
[10:34] and there it is boudin castle
[10:44] [Music]
[10:52] [Music]
[10:55] have I seriously got to try and get
[10:57] through that that's not happening is it
[11:01] [Music]
[11:05] people chasing me we've got six
[11:09] kilometers to go for miles
[11:13] [Music]
[11:19] [Music]
[11:32] [Music]
[11:38] so this commences finish now see what it
[11:41] needs to go and it's been served
[11:48] it's not luggage
[11:52] [Music]
[12:17] oh this this grass up to here there's
[12:21] stinging nettles and and thorn bushes at
[12:24] eye level and base level with a path
[12:27] this right sometimes you don't even know
[12:30] if it's the right path even though it
[12:31] says still on you the only I went right
[12:42] through the middle of a bunch of
[12:44] stinging nettles through one of the
[12:47] vineyards because I couldn't work out
[12:50] which way around the vineyard it was so
[12:52] she went right through the bloody middle
[12:53] of it
[12:59] so here I am in front of the famous
[13:02] Battle Abbey site of the Battle of
[13:04] Hastings I always think is really weird
[13:07] how they managed to fight in a place
[13:09] called battle anyway I finished the 1066
[13:15] 100-mile ultra in 26 hours 46 minutes
[13:20] that was really really hard work but I
[13:23] came in 10th place so that shows that it
[13:25] was hard for everyone so that's it from
[13:29] battle here in East Sussex join me again
[13:30] for another marathon another ultra

[13:34] been a crazy adventure let me tell you
