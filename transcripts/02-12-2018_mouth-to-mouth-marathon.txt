[00:54] so if I came to the mathematic would
[00:57] come up to the bridge that crosses the
[00:59] river and then we're doing the South
[01:01] Downs Way

[03:17] run eternity play from behind be the
[03:18] last person so for the past couple of
[03:26] days I've had a little bit of a painful
[03:28] chest and I'm fairly sure it's because I
[03:31] rolled over onto my headphones in the
[03:33] middle of the night but various people
[03:38] told me you should get that checked out
[03:39] so I went to the hospital yesterday
[03:41] carried out an ECG and some blood tests
[03:43] which we're all fine so come the end of
[03:46] this mouthing I look a bit pale
[03:49] apparently so the paramedic guy here is
[03:52] just double-checking that my heart is
[03:55] functioning all right one two three go
