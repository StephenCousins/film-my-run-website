==================================================

[00:00] Whoever marked this course was having a laugh.
[00:12] With some of the most technical terrain  you will find on a 50k race, 3300  
[00:20] metres of elevation gain and two ascents  of Snowdon this is the UTS 50k by UTMB.
[00:54] Welcome to Film My Run. My name's Stephen.  Here we are in Wales, in Snowdonia to be  
[00:59] precise. We're here to run the 50k of the  UTMB World Series Event. This is the only  
[01:06] event in the UK which is a World Series  Event for UTMB, where you can earn  
[01:11] Running Stones. There's the 165 which  was abandoned earlier on for bad weather.  
[01:15] There’s the 100k which went off at four o'clock  this morning in torrential rain. It has cleared  
[01:21] up for the 50k. We're gonna have a lovely  time. So we'll see you out on the course.
[01:56] What's your name? Dan. Where'd you live  Dan? East Sussex, Crowborough. And why  
[02:01] have you come up to this today? Well we were  on the 165 yesterday got stopped in the night.
[02:10] Well good for you for getting up again. How far  did you get yesterday, 40k? A bit further I think.  
[02:19] Yeah, it was pretty horrendous wasn't it? It did  get pretty rough yeah. Film My Run? Yes, hi buddy  
[02:27] hello. What's your name? Louie. from where? Hong  Kong. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.  
[02:33] Right every single UTMB race in the world suffers  from this, because there are so many runners.  
[02:40] You get to about 2k in, nobody has spread  out, you get to a tiny little fence or a  
[02:46] gate post or something, and everybody's queued  back for miles. But that's just UTMB for you.  
[03:01] I'm sure this is a harder  effort than it should be!
[03:09] So we've climbed about 400 metres now in the  UTS 50k. We've travelled nearly six kilometres  
[03:17] in about an hour, so we're doing all right.  Vic's doing well. We’ve got some absolutely  
[03:23] gorgeous views behind us here, and the runners  all snaking their way up the hill there. Amazing.  
[03:33] This is what we're here for. This is  what you come to these places for.
[03:57] Relieved to have made it to the top of the  first climb. Just want to get this done.
[04:25] Thank you. Right, first checkpoint at 15 and a  half k. 10 miles nearly. It had been the perfect  
[04:35] start. Windy, but dry. A nice easy first climb on  very comfortable terrain. It wasn't going to last  
[05:10] right. We're about 21 kilometres into the  UTS 50k and we're at the top of… now I've  
[05:17] already forgotten it. We're at the top  of Mynydd Mawr, which is about 700 metres  
[05:24] above sea level. We've done that in three  hours 41. Hello Melissa! How's it going?  
[05:30] Yeah? They're doing lattes up here. Ice cream if  you want it. Have you pushed my wife off a cliff?
[05:40] Sorry? She bloody well is, isn't she.  Unbelievable. She'll talk to anyone.  
[05:45] All right? Top of the second climb.  oh, thank God for that. Come on.
[05:53] So we're just descending down  to the second aid station now.  
[05:57] So we'll be coming up on 25k, halfway. But  we've got to go down this lovely ridge first.
[06:16] This chap, James, managed to climb over this  style, slip off and land on his arm. But you're  
[06:21] all right? I'm all right. I'm all right. Onwards  and downwards! What was that hill all about?
[06:34] Right we are 24 kilometres into the UTS 50k  
[06:38] and it's not been without  its mud. As you can see here.
[06:52] You're loving it and you know it. I see you've  given up on trying to keep your feet dry now.  
[07:06] Right second checkpoint. This is halfway  now. Four and a half hours, so we're still  
[07:11] on for between 10 and 12. But we've got the  hardest bit to come now. Mynydd Mawr had been  
[07:17] far more demanding, both up and  down, with very steep gradients,  
[07:22] lots of mud and deep bogs. Things  were beginning to get interesting.
[07:29] We’ve got to go up Snowdon twice now. Yeah we've  got we go Snowdon to the summit and then we  
[07:35] come down and then we go Snowdon just up to the  standing stone, which isn't quite to the summit.  
[07:42] And then it's down the  Llanberis path to the finish.
[07:46] But we're enjoying it aren't we Vic? D'you know, we are.  
[07:51] It's flipping hard work  but I'm really enjoying it.
[08:10] We've got 1.3 kilometres left  to get to the summit of Snowdon.  
[08:15] You might just be able to see the  summit of Snowdon in the distance there.  
[08:19] It is it is just shrouded by cloud but it's just  about visible. Victoria is absolutely shattered,  
[08:30] but we only have 1000 metres left of climbing  in the entire race and about 20k to go.
[08:43] So we're on the top of Snowdon. Victoria's just  
[08:46] sorting a few things out and then  we're going to make our way down.
[08:56] And this is where the UTS 50k  became something really special.
[09:03] Climbing down the notoriously difficult  Watkin Path demands your full concentration.  
[09:13] And then scrambling along the superb  ridge and up the rocks and boulders  
[09:17] to climb to the summit of Y Lliwedd  is as exciting as it is exhilarating.
[09:27] This section at 20 miles in, is what sky  running and mountain racing is all about.
[09:37] If you're looking to get into mountain racing,  
[09:39] this would be a perfect introduction.  We were absolutely buzzing after this.
[09:54] So we're on top of Y Lliwedd. Remember  we were on top of Snowdon over there  
[09:58] about an hour or so ago, and I saw that beautiful  ridge. So we climbed all the way along that  
[10:03] beautiful ridge and we've made it to the top of  this summit. So we've got one more summit to do.  
[10:08] Downhill to get to the aid station, 4k. Then  back up Snowdon and then down the Llanberis  
[10:17] path to the finish. Spectacular isn't it?  Absolutely amazing views. Love it.
[10:28] So we've had this hilarious section to scramble  down on our bums, which has been great.  
[10:35] The barrel of laughs section. How  we laughed on the way down.
[10:41] So we've just finished the descent from  Snowdon. Beautiful sunshine on the lake there  
[10:47] and we've got about a kilometre to  go until we get to the aid station.  
[10:52] 37 kilometres in seven hours 55  minutes. So just shy of eight hours.
[11:11] Yeah we're really tired now. We're  looking for this final aid station which  
[11:15] I thought was about 38 kilometres. Well we're now  at 38 and a half there's no sign of it anywhere.  
[11:25] Okay, so that is Pen y Pass aid station. It's  the final aid station at about 39 kilometres.  
[11:32] So all we need to do now is head up the Pyg track.
[11:44] Victoria is incredibly tired, but  she's ahead of me at the moment.  
[11:48] She's just forcing her way  up the final climb here.
[11:52] We've got about two kilometres of distance left  
[11:57] and about 350 metres of climbing  left to do before we reach the top.
[12:11] So, Dan, we've noticed on the way up this final  climb, he speeds past us and then we'll see him  
[12:18] sitting down. Then we'll speed past him and he  says “I’m just having a rest”. Then five minutes  
[12:25] later he's sped past us again! How many times  have you done it so far? Four or five. Listen,  
[12:32] we are nearly there. Well done Dan. Keep it going.  We are in the final section of the Pyg track now.  
[12:42] Eventually, after nine hours and 55 minutes,  we made it to the top of the Pyg track and  
[12:48] started our descent into Llanberis. So 44  kilometres done, just seven to go down the hill.
[13:06] So near the end now. Lovely little forest  at the end and the bridge and the stream.
[13:12] Film My Run!  
[13:18] Cheers, hello buddy. Thank you.
[14:05] And just like that, our UTS 50k was  over. It had taken us 11 hours and  
[14:12] 16 minutes to travel the 52 kilometres and  climb over 3000 metres of elevation gain.  
[14:20] And now Victoria has her two UTMB Running  Stones and is a bona fide ultra mountain runner.
[14:38] Look who we bumped into on the path. Mark  Derbyshire. So record holder for the Arc of  
[14:45] Attrition. Record holder for Lakeland 100, and was  in the lead of the 100 mile race here yesterday,  
[14:52] when it was abandoned. Are you feeling alright  though? Feel good yeah. Are you disappointed about  
[14:57] the 100? Yeah a little bit. Not disappointed,  more sort of a little bit frustrated.  
[15:02] You put a lot of put a lot of mental effort and  training into it, and then it was going well.  
[15:11] What's next? UTMB’s next. Well  we'll see yeah we should….
