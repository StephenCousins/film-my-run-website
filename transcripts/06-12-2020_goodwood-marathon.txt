============================================================

i ran my first marathon in april 2012. i was 42 years old hello and welcome to paris that's my number one until then i'd been a casual runner of course i ran at school and occasionally went jogging on the sea front near my home but i'd not entered a race or done any serious training until 2010 when i entered my first 10k race how do you feel [Music] that's the fastest time i've done it here congratulations is that the last time you're running yes a half marathon followed and before i knew it i was on the slippery slope over the next eight years i started to do trail marathons i joined a running club then i started to do long distance ultra races my marathon time gradually improved from around 3 30 average to 3 15 and eventually in 2016 i ran the london marathon in 309 training to achieve a sub three marathon takes years okay there are some people who are gifted or genetically primed and can run under three hours with minimal training or preparation but for the rest of us it starts when you first start running once you step out of the door to run your first mile that's when you start training for a sub three marathon initially it's about building a strong aerobic base and conditioning your body new runners will often suffer niggle after niggle as their bodies adapt to regular running it can take many years of consistent running to get to a stage where you rarely get injured where you can get up in the morning and run 10 miles without breaking a sweat and run a half marathon without drinking any water once you've got that base fitness the next step is volume gradually increasing the number of miles you run each week and again this can take years i was running about 40 miles a week for quite a few years before i upped my game and started running a consistent 62 miles or 100 kilometers a week and if you want to break three hours for a marathon that's the kind of mileage you need to be looking at in the six months prior to my sub three marathon i ran at least 100 kilometers a week and had some weeks at 130 kilometers some weeks of 140 kilometers and one week of 150 kilometers i adopted an 80 20 strategy whereby 80 percent of your sessions are at a very slow pace this enabled me to achieve large volumes but without getting over fatigued or injured but i also included 20 of hard efforts either on the treadmill or outdoors i did high intensity interval sessions or short sharp 5k time trials where i'd make sure my heart rate reached zones four and zone five if i could at least some of the time i tried to stay clear of that comfortable zone 3 void it's unavoidable that you spend some time in that zone but i'd never plan a session to be a zone 3 session no one is going to hand you a sub 3 marathon on a plate you need to work for it in all likelihood you should be running an 1835k absolutely shattered 1833 or a 38 minute 10k or a one hour 25 half marathon that's a pb by two minutes to be within the ballpark of being able to achieve a sub three marathon in terms of a taper two weeks before the marathon i reduced my mileage from 130 kilometers down to 100 kilometers and then in the week of the marathon i think i did about 30 kilometers before the marathon so that whole week including the marathon was about 70 odd kilometers of running [Music] in the weeks prior to the marathon i ate a normal diet i do tend to be flexitarian so hardly any red meat but perhaps some chicken occasionally i do find it hard to resist the cookies and milk though what seven days before the marathon i did a three day carb depletion so i ate very minimal carbohydrates for 72 hours and then went back on the carbs with a slightly higher ratio of carbs to fats and proteins i wouldn't call it carb loading i don't really do carb loading it's just a slightly altered ratio of macronutrients so slightly more carbs than proteins and fats and certainly in normal circumstances i would just eat a balanced diet eat bread and desserts and just get all fat and sassy race day breakfast was a tin of rice pudding and a couple of cups of coffee rice pudding sits easily on my stomach it's a great source of slow release complex carbohydrates during the race itself i ate one half of a banana at 20 miles and drank one small bottle of purdy's fizzy fruit drink but it could quite easily have been a can of coke or red bull basically a bit of slow release complex carbohydrates in the banana and a hit of high gi simple sugar from the fizzy drink that's it it was a cold day and i didn't lose very much fluid as sweat so i didn't drink anything else for the duration of the run so just to be clear on this i didn't drink or eat anything during the marathon for 20 miles you may have heard the term fat adapted if you're looking to run long distances you might want to look into running some of your training runs on empty you don't need to take lots of food with you don't take any food with you especially if it's not a long run you know anything around 10 to 20 kilometers you may you don't need any food at all i often just go out with just a cup of coffee inside me no breakfast and what i think is that that teaches your body to burn fat more efficiently which means you need to use fewer gels or sugary drinks in order to give yourself energy to run that may not work for you but a lot of the gastric problems in ultra running in long distance running are caused by too much sugar intake overload of coke or gels hi guys and i think if you can cut down on that then all the better it was cold when i did my sub 3 marathon attempt so on a warmer day you probably will need to drink more water because you'll lose more fluid through your sweat however on a cold day i honestly didn't need to drink anything at all because it was so cold at the start of the race i did wear a light montane fleece over my race singlet i did three laps in that which is about 10 kilometers and then i threw it to the side of the road i kept a thin light pair of gloves on and a cap for the whole race i wear compression shorts not for any medical or physiological reason per se but simply i find them more comfortable than regular shorts my compression shorts are from a spanish company called hanker i also wore kalenji seamless running underwear to help prevent chafing but i didn't have any anti-chafe cream on on my feet i wore in gingy toe socks these are the same ones i tend to wear for my 24 hour 100 mile adventures very comfortable and no blisters i also wore the next percent nike vapor flies these are carbon plated shoes they're legal and they help you go faster so why not wear them i only wear them for races and never in training my current watch is a garmin phoenix 6x sapphire it's what i use for most of my training and races it's quite big in bulk and it's probably overkill for a flat road marathon [Music] when it comes to pacing i am a huge fan of even splits and negative splits so i would try to run most of my kilometers at exactly the same pace and then speed up at the end if i had anything left on the main screen i had average pace in kilometers per hour and lap pace in minutes per kilometer i'm a regular treadmill runner so i'm quite used to seeing my speed displayed in kilometers per hour for a sub 3 marathon you need to run 14.1 kilometers per hour or 4 minutes 16 per kilometer or 650 per mile ideally a little faster than that to account for any extra distance you might accrue by not sticking to the exact racing line obviously in a race you may well be weaving around people that is adding distance so crossing the line at 42.2 kilometers is highly unlikely it's much more likely to be a little bit more than that lap pace was difficult to keep constant because it was quite windy on one side of the track but calm on the other side so some kilometers were slow into the wind whilst others were fast with the wind behind me or still prior to the race i'd looked at various online race predictors and they all told me that i was right on the cusp of a sub three marathon some said just over three hours some said just under three hours but all of them with a margin of error and unlike many of my other marathons and i've now done 120 of them it was not a case of fingers crossed and hope i have a good day this was a matter of running as i knew i could running as i knew i should and executing a plan that i was perfectly capable of doing i had run an 1835k in a race just a few weeks before i'd also done a test half marathon where i ran really comfortably at one and a half hours for a half marathon keeping my heart rate low so i knew i could get at least there all i had to do was concentrate focus and carry out the plan right it's pb day here at goodwood we are going for a sub three marathon i'm nervous it's freezing cold uh it's been a stressful morning but hopefully we're gonna get it done i crossed the line in two hours 58 minutes 57 seconds on my watch the distance was 42.4 kilometers so an extra 200 meters run i did have to sprint the last little bit just to make sure i got in under three hours right richard how was that for you cold card and i think i probably matched my tv so i'm pretty happy 303 um it was just disgusting into that wind wasn't it yeah i really dread that little bend but it's quite a big bend so the loop is about what 4k long loop something like that and two two and a half kilometers of it is into a wind even if it's like a a mild day which today is it's you're into a wind because it's quite exposed so you're kind of dreading that two and a half k every lap and it's like 11 laps still 303 for richard and my first ever sub three 258 59ish something like that i can now retire i never have to run another marathon ever again and i do no so that's it from the goodwood marathon we are off home it's very very cold here don't realize how cold it is until you stop running but we've had a fantastic day first time ever under three hours for a marathon so happy with that and uh we're off home to enjoy the rest of our sunday apologies there hasn't been loads of film it wasn't a filming day today it was a running quick day today so there we are right take care guys see you for the next one bye bye and that's it that's how i achieved my sub three marathon after eight years of running marathons i'm finally there and now i think i'd be disappointed if i didn't get close to a sub three road marathon every time [Music] [Music] [Music] you

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

[00:05] i ran my first marathon
[00:06] in april 2012. i was 42 years old
[00:11] hello and welcome to paris that's my
[00:13] number
[00:14] one
[00:19] until then i'd been a casual runner of
[00:21] course i ran at school and occasionally
[00:23] went jogging on the sea front near my
[00:25] home but
[00:26] i'd not entered a race or done any
[00:28] serious training
[00:29] until 2010 when i entered my first
[00:32] 10k race how do you feel
[00:35] [Music]
[00:37] that's the fastest time i've done it
[00:38] here congratulations
[00:40] is that the last time you're running yes
[00:43] a half marathon followed and before i
[00:45] knew it i was on the slippery slope
[00:48] over the next eight years i started to
[00:50] do trail marathons i joined a running
[00:52] club then i started to do
[00:53] long distance ultra races my marathon
[00:57] time
[00:57] gradually improved from around 3 30
[01:00] average
[01:01] to 3 15 and eventually in 2016 i ran the
[01:05] london marathon in 309
[01:14] training to achieve a sub three marathon
[01:17] takes years okay there are some people
[01:20] who are gifted or
[01:21] genetically primed and can run under
[01:23] three hours with minimal training or
[01:25] preparation
[01:26] but for the rest of us it starts when
[01:28] you first start running
[01:30] once you step out of the door to run
[01:32] your first mile
[01:34] that's when you start training for a sub
[01:36] three marathon
[01:38] initially it's about building a strong
[01:40] aerobic base and conditioning your body
[01:43] new runners will often suffer niggle
[01:45] after niggle as their bodies adapt to
[01:47] regular running
[01:48] it can take many years of consistent
[01:51] running to get to a stage where you
[01:53] rarely get injured where you can get up
[01:55] in the morning and run
[01:56] 10 miles without breaking a sweat and
[01:59] run a half marathon without drinking any
[02:01] water
[02:02] once you've got that base fitness the
[02:04] next step is volume
[02:06] gradually increasing the number of miles
[02:08] you run each week
[02:10] and again this can take years i was
[02:12] running about
[02:13] 40 miles a week for quite a few years
[02:16] before i upped my game and started
[02:17] running a consistent
[02:19] 62 miles or 100 kilometers a week
[02:23] and if you want to break three hours for
[02:25] a marathon that's the kind of mileage
[02:26] you need to be looking at
[02:29] in the six months prior to my sub three
[02:31] marathon i ran at least
[02:32] 100 kilometers a week and had some weeks
[02:35] at 130 kilometers
[02:37] some weeks of 140 kilometers and one
[02:40] week
[02:40] of 150 kilometers i adopted an 80
[02:44] 20 strategy whereby 80 percent of your
[02:47] sessions are at a very
[02:49] slow pace this enabled me to achieve
[02:52] large volumes but without getting over
[02:55] fatigued or injured
[02:57] but i also included 20 of hard efforts
[03:00] either on the treadmill or outdoors i
[03:03] did high
[03:04] intensity interval sessions or short
[03:06] sharp 5k
[03:07] time trials where i'd make sure my heart
[03:09] rate reached
[03:10] zones four and zone five if i could at
[03:12] least some of the time
[03:14] i tried to stay clear of that
[03:16] comfortable zone 3
[03:18] void it's unavoidable that you spend
[03:20] some time in that zone but
[03:21] i'd never plan a session to be a zone 3
[03:24] session
[03:25] no one is going to hand you a sub 3
[03:27] marathon on a plate
[03:29] you need to work for it in all
[03:31] likelihood you should be running an
[03:34] 1835k absolutely shattered
[03:38] 1833 or a 38 minute 10k
[03:42] or a one hour 25 half marathon that's a
[03:46] pb
[03:47] by two minutes to be within the ballpark
[03:50] of being able to achieve a sub
[03:52] three marathon in terms of a taper
[03:55] two weeks before the marathon i reduced
[03:57] my mileage
[03:59] from 130 kilometers down to 100
[04:02] kilometers
[04:03] and then in the week of the marathon i
[04:05] think i did about
[04:06] 30 kilometers before the marathon so
[04:08] that whole week including the marathon
[04:10] was about
[04:11] 70 odd kilometers of running
[04:14] [Music]
[04:19] in the weeks prior to the marathon i ate
[04:22] a normal diet i do tend to be
[04:24] flexitarian so hardly any red meat but
[04:27] perhaps some
[04:28] chicken occasionally i do find it hard
[04:30] to resist the cookies and milk though
[04:32] what
[04:34] seven days before the marathon i did a
[04:36] three day carb depletion
[04:38] so i ate very minimal carbohydrates for
[04:41] 72
[04:42] hours and then went back on the carbs
[04:45] with a slightly higher ratio of carbs to
[04:47] fats and proteins
[04:49] i wouldn't call it carb loading i don't
[04:51] really do carb loading it's just a
[04:53] slightly altered
[04:54] ratio of macronutrients so slightly more
[04:57] carbs
[04:58] than proteins and fats and certainly in
[05:00] normal circumstances
[05:02] i would just eat a balanced diet
[05:05] eat bread and desserts and just get all
[05:08] fat and sassy
[05:10] race day breakfast was a tin of rice
[05:12] pudding and a couple of cups of coffee
[05:14] rice pudding sits easily on my stomach
[05:17] it's a great source of
[05:18] slow release complex carbohydrates
[05:21] during the race itself i ate one half of
[05:24] a banana at 20 miles
[05:26] and drank one small bottle of purdy's
[05:28] fizzy fruit drink
[05:30] but it could quite easily have been a
[05:32] can of coke or red bull
[05:34] basically a bit of slow release complex
[05:37] carbohydrates in the banana
[05:39] and a hit of high gi simple sugar from
[05:42] the fizzy drink
[05:43] that's it it was a cold day and i didn't
[05:46] lose
[05:46] very much fluid as sweat so i didn't
[05:48] drink anything else for the duration of
[05:50] the run
[05:51] so just to be clear on this i didn't
[05:54] drink or eat
[05:55] anything during the marathon for 20
[05:57] miles
[05:58] you may have heard the term fat adapted
[06:01] if you're looking to run long distances
[06:04] you might want to look into
[06:07] running some of your training runs on
[06:09] empty you don't need to take lots of
[06:11] food with you don't take any food with
[06:13] you especially if it's not a long
[06:14] run you know anything
[06:18] around 10 to 20 kilometers you may you
[06:21] don't need any food at all
[06:23] i often just go out with just a cup of
[06:26] coffee inside me
[06:28] no breakfast and what i
[06:32] think is that that teaches your body to
[06:34] burn fat
[06:36] more efficiently which means you need to
[06:39] use
[06:39] fewer gels or sugary drinks
[06:44] in order to give yourself energy to run
[06:48] that may not work for you but a lot of
[06:51] the gastric problems
[06:52] in ultra running in long distance
[06:54] running are caused
[06:56] by too much sugar intake
[06:59] overload of coke or gels
[07:04] hi guys
[07:07] and i think if you can cut down on that
[07:10] then all the better
[07:12] it was cold when i did my sub 3 marathon
[07:14] attempt so
[07:15] on a warmer day you probably will need
[07:17] to drink more water because you'll lose
[07:19] more fluid through your sweat however on
[07:22] a cold day
[07:23] i honestly didn't need to drink anything
[07:25] at all
[07:32] because it was so cold at the start of
[07:34] the race i did wear a light
[07:36] montane fleece over my race singlet i
[07:38] did
[07:39] three laps in that which is about 10
[07:41] kilometers and then i threw it to the
[07:43] side of the road
[07:44] i kept a thin light pair of gloves on
[07:47] and a cap for the whole race
[07:50] i wear compression shorts not for any
[07:52] medical or physiological reason per se
[07:55] but simply i find them more comfortable
[07:57] than regular shorts
[07:58] my compression shorts are from a spanish
[08:00] company called hanker
[08:02] i also wore kalenji seamless running
[08:04] underwear to help prevent chafing
[08:06] but i didn't have any anti-chafe cream
[08:09] on
[08:10] on my feet i wore in gingy toe socks
[08:12] these are the same ones i tend to wear
[08:14] for my 24 hour 100 mile adventures
[08:17] very comfortable and no blisters i also
[08:21] wore the next percent
[08:22] nike vapor flies these are carbon plated
[08:25] shoes they're legal
[08:26] and they help you go faster so why not
[08:28] wear them i only wear them for races and
[08:30] never in training
[08:32] my current watch is a garmin phoenix 6x
[08:35] sapphire it's what i use for most of my
[08:38] training and races it's quite big in
[08:40] bulk and it's probably overkill for a
[08:42] flat road marathon
[08:48] [Music]
[08:50] when it comes to pacing i am a huge fan
[08:52] of even splits and negative splits
[08:55] so i would try to run most of my
[08:57] kilometers at exactly the same pace and
[09:00] then speed up at the end if i had
[09:02] anything left
[09:04] on the main screen i had average pace in
[09:06] kilometers per hour
[09:08] and lap pace in minutes per kilometer
[09:10] i'm a regular treadmill runner so i'm
[09:12] quite used to seeing my speed displayed
[09:15] in kilometers per hour
[09:17] for a sub 3 marathon you need to run
[09:20] 14.1 kilometers
[09:22] per hour or 4 minutes 16 per kilometer
[09:25] or
[09:26] 650 per mile ideally a little faster
[09:29] than that to account for any extra
[09:31] distance you might accrue
[09:32] by not sticking to the exact racing line
[09:35] obviously in a race you may well be
[09:37] weaving around people
[09:38] that is adding distance so crossing the
[09:41] line at 42.2 kilometers
[09:44] is highly unlikely it's much more likely
[09:46] to be a little bit more than that
[09:48] lap pace was difficult to keep constant
[09:50] because it was quite windy on one side
[09:52] of the track
[09:53] but calm on the other side so some
[09:55] kilometers were slow
[09:56] into the wind whilst others were fast
[09:59] with the wind behind me or still
[10:02] prior to the race i'd looked at various
[10:04] online race predictors
[10:06] and they all told me that i was right on
[10:08] the cusp
[10:09] of a sub three marathon some said just
[10:12] over three hours
[10:13] some said just under three hours but all
[10:15] of them with a margin of error
[10:17] and unlike many of my other marathons
[10:19] and i've now done 120 of them
[10:22] it was not a case of fingers crossed and
[10:24] hope i have a good day
[10:26] this was a matter of running as i knew i
[10:28] could
[10:29] running as i knew i should and executing
[10:32] a plan that i was perfectly capable of
[10:35] doing
[10:36] i had run an 1835k in a race
[10:40] just a few weeks before i'd also done a
[10:42] test
[10:43] half marathon where i ran really
[10:45] comfortably
[10:46] at one and a half hours for a half
[10:48] marathon keeping my heart rate low
[10:50] so i knew i could get at least there all
[10:53] i had to do
[10:54] was concentrate focus and carry out the
[10:57] plan
[10:58] right it's pb day here at goodwood we
[11:01] are going for a sub
[11:02] three marathon i'm nervous it's freezing
[11:04] cold uh it's been a stressful morning
[11:06] but hopefully we're gonna get it done i
[11:09] crossed the line
[11:10] in two hours 58 minutes 57 seconds
[11:14] on my watch the distance was 42.4
[11:18] kilometers so an extra 200 meters run i
[11:21] did have to sprint the last little bit
[11:23] just to make sure i got in
[11:25] under three hours
[11:33] right richard how was that for you cold
[11:38] card and i think i probably matched my
[11:41] tv
[11:42] so i'm pretty happy 303
[11:46] um it was just disgusting into that wind
[11:48] wasn't it yeah
[11:49] i really dread that little bend but it's
[11:51] quite a big bend so the loop is about
[11:53] what 4k long loop something like that
[11:56] and two two and a half kilometers of it
[11:59] is into a wind even if it's like a
[12:02] a mild day which today is it's you're
[12:05] into a wind
[12:06] because it's quite exposed so you're
[12:08] kind of dreading that two and a half k
[12:10] every lap and it's like 11 laps still
[12:14] 303 for richard and my first ever sub
[12:17] three
[12:18] 258 59ish something like that
[12:22] i can now retire i never have to run
[12:24] another marathon ever again
[12:26] and i do no
[12:29] so that's it from the goodwood marathon
[12:30] we are off home
[12:32] it's very very cold here don't realize
[12:34] how cold it is until you stop running
[12:37] but we've had a fantastic day
[12:40] first time ever under three hours for a
[12:43] marathon so
[12:44] happy with that and uh we're off home to
[12:47] enjoy the rest of our sunday
[12:49] apologies there hasn't been loads of
[12:50] film it wasn't a filming day today it
[12:54] was
[12:54] a running quick day today so there we
[12:57] are right take care guys see you for the
[12:59] next one
[13:00] bye bye and that's it that's how i
[13:04] achieved
[13:04] my sub three marathon after eight years
[13:08] of running marathons
[13:09] i'm finally there and now i think i'd be
[13:12] disappointed
[13:13] if i didn't get close to a sub three
[13:15] road marathon
