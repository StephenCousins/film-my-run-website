==================================================

[00:00] How do you convince your family that you  should do a race thousands of miles away  
[00:04] on a beautiful sun kissed island? I learned  a long time ago that selling the idea of me  
[00:11] running an Ultra abroad is a lot easier  when it's couched as a family holiday.  
[00:17] We've been coming to the Canary Islands  with our friends for 10 years now and we  
[00:22] do love Gran Canaria very much. Trans Gran  Canaria has always been a stellar event,  
[00:28] but now as part of the World Trail  Majors, it's been elevated even more.
[00:33] The Expo is bigger, there are more runners and  it feels more prestigious. This year there were  
[00:39] plenty of Brits on the island, many of whom keep  coming back just like us. Right, this is Steve.
[00:45] Steve's doing this for the fifth time.  What's your best time on the course,  
[00:49] Steve? 21:20. That was in 2017, I think.
[00:53] Why do you come back to this race  every year? I love the terrain and  
[00:58] the middle of the island and the atmosphere  during the race. It's great. Great one.
[01:04] Thank you. That is me. Thank you very much.
[01:06] You are in. You cannot get  out of it. Enjoy your taper.
[01:10] Thanks a lot. So here we are at the Expo. Just got  
[01:13] my number ready for my third attempt  at the Trans Gran Canaria Classic.
[01:18] Finished it twice before. Never got under 24  hours. Would love to get under 24 hours if I can.
[01:27] We're at the finish line of the marathon. This  is about, about 10 hours before I start my RA  
[01:35] and we're waiting for James Elson from Centurion  Running to come in. He's doing the marathon today.
[01:41] Not only did we have James Elson  running the marathon distance,  
[01:45] but the UK's Mark Darbyshire was down  to run the Classic. And I also spotted  
[01:51] ultra legend Pau Capel hanging out at the  finish line. So I grabbed him for a photo.
[01:57] Then it was back to the hotel  to relax before my race. It's  
[02:01] about nine, nine o'clock. Just  getting really nervous now.
[02:06] Gonna leave for the bus in about half  an hour. After what went on at the  
[02:10] Swiss Alps 100 and with my injured foot just  feeling a little bit tense about it all. Our  
[02:19] hotel was situated just a short walk from  Parc del Sur, where I would catch the bus  
[02:24] up to the start line in Las Palmas and where  hopefully I would finish the race the next day,  
[02:30] I said goodbye to the family and  settled down for the journey north.
[02:35] In previous years, the race had started at 11pm  but they've now moved it one hour later. For me,  
[02:42] that midnight start means less darkness  at the beginning of the race, but more  
[02:46] at the end. The elite runners, of course,  don't have to worry about a second night.
[02:53] Once I'd got off the bus and  found my way to the start,  
[02:57] my nerves settled a little and I enjoyed the  atmosphere and the build up. I ate a banana,  
[03:03] had a protein shake and a coffee. I managed  to use the the loo and applied lube.
[03:08] I met up with my friend Sarah and we stood  towards the back of the field. So despite injury  
[03:14] and illness, we are absolutely delighted to be  back on the start line of the Trans Gran Canaria  
[03:21] Classic here in Las Palmas. In Gran Canaria  we're going to run and we are going to run  
[03:28] 126ish kilometers all the way from the top of Gran  Canaria right down to the bottom at Maspalomas.
[03:35] Sarah's going to drag me kicking and  screaming and I am going to get to the end.  
[03:40] We didn't have long to wait  before the fireworks started,  
[03:43] the music reached crescendo and  the announcer sent us on our way.
[03:48] Although because we were near the back,  
[03:50] it took us a while to actually cross  the timing mat. This is it. Away we go.
[03:57] I'm going to be taking it  super relaxed. Yes, same here.  
[04:38] The first 400 meters is a procession along  the beach and then up onto the promenade for  
[04:43] the next 4km. At this point I was very happy  to be wearing my HOKA Skyward X road shoes.
[04:50] I mean it's going to be like  this all the way, right?  
[05:03] We're 5k in 32 minutes gone on the first climb,  which is kind of old tarmac road snaking up  
[05:13] this hill. Loads of lights in front, loads of  lights behind and it's a beautiful warm evening.  
[05:33] With well over 6,000 meters of elevation gain.  You spend most of Trans Gran Canaria climbing  
[05:39] and you don't reach the highest point of  the race until around 100km after 10k.
[05:45] I didn't do another sub 7 minute kilometer  for the rest of the race either because of  
[05:51] the terrain underfoot, the steep gradient  or Both. Around about 11 kilometres in at  
[05:58] 1 hour 16 minutes and we've arrived at  our first aid station, Tenoya. Because  
[06:06] I'd done the race a couple of times before, I  was able to break down the different sections.
[06:12] On one hand that can be good because  you can plan and manage your race,  
[06:16] but on the other hand it can be daunting  when you're fully aware of the magnitude  
[06:20] of what's to come. Two and a half hours  in and about 17, 18 kilometers in, but  
[06:35] I think people up ahead are finding  it pretty tricky going. Hi Stephen.
[06:40] Hi, how are you? Not too bad. And it's  very slow walking pace at the moment.  
[06:47] You can see up ahead of us just line of  head torches all trying to get up the.
[06:53] I mean, admittedly, fairly steep climb, but yeah,  
[06:57] I think some people are taking it pretty  easy up this climb pretty slowly. All  
[07:21] right trouble?
[07:22] How's it going? Oh, good, yeah.  Are you? Yeah, I think so. No, no.
[07:28] Okay, this aid station closes at 3:40, so we're  well in time. We've got 40, 50, 50 minutes or so  
[07:37] on this one. 107 kilometers to the finish line  and 12 kilometers to the next eight stations.
[07:47] So we're at 19K. A long way to go.  
[08:07] This climb that I'm on now is  very, very steep in parts. And  
[08:15] in 2022 we had a storm and the rain lashed  down and this bit was absolutely treacherous.
[08:26] And it took us so long to get up here. It was  just a river of mud on a very steep bank with a  
[08:36] drop on this side to my left. Oh, it was, it was  pretty horrendous, but it's much better today.
[08:46] Very dry, still steep, but doable.  Still about 100k. 105k to go.
[09:29] I think that is where the advanced race  must start tomorrow. So that's the 65k,  
[09:37] but we've got more than 65k to go before we get  home. Maybe they do a less circuitous route.
[09:46] Just coming into the next aid  station at 20 miles in. So,  
[09:51] yeah, 20 miles done, 60 miles to go, by my  calculations. I'm feeling rough actually.
[10:05] So the next aid session will be Fontanales,  which will be over a marathon done, that is  
[10:10] in 11 and a half kilometers from now. We have 95  kilometers to go to the finish line. And this,  
[10:18] this aid station is a cut off of 6 hours, 10  minutes or 6:10 in the morning, and it's now 5:19.
[10:27] So we've got 50 minutes here. Okay, I'm leaving.  Got bread, I've had coke, been to the loo.
[10:42] I felt a bit uncomfortable on that last  section, so I'm glad I've been to the  
[10:46] loo. 11 and a half kilometers to the next  checkpoint. One foot in front of the other.
[10:53] That's all it is. I've also put some  ibuprofen gel on my foot. It's not  
[10:59] doing too badly, but I'm just aware  that I don't want it to give up on me.
[11:08] But we're doing all right at the moment.  
[11:30] Moving through the night, we spent  our time climbing and then dropping  
[11:34] down into small towns and villages with a  mix of dry, dusty trails and tarmac roads.
[11:40] I managed to get a marathon distance  covered during the cool hours of  
[11:44] darkness. All I could think of as the  sun rose was please don't get too hot.  
[12:04] So we finally arrived at Fontanales aid station,  which is supposed to be 43 and a half K.
[12:11] I've got nearly 45K on my watch, so time for food.  Okay, I am weighed up with things now to eat,  
[12:25] drink. I've got Coca Cola, I've  got banana, I've got bread, sweets.
[12:35] Nine and a half K to the next aid station. So that  looks like for me it's going to be 55k, basically.
[12:43] 55k I'm going to hit when I get there. We have  83k to the finish. Okay, we're on our way.
[12:52] I needed that stop. Got a big vat  of Coke as well. I feel like we're  
[13:04] gonna hit some sunshine soon and  it's going to start getting warm.
[13:09] That's what I'm worried about now. But  my ankle is holding out just about.
[13:16] I'm not gonna lie, it's aching, but it's  not, it's not hurting. Amazing cloud  
[13:39] inversion behind me over there. North side of  the island, you see, never gets any sunshine.
[13:45] Clear and blue that way. From here is where the  Trans Gran Canaria classic really comes into its  
[13:54] own. The national parks around the centre of the  island are stunning and the views spectacular.
[14:00] Of course, with the rising of the sun comes  new energy and positivity, and I absolutely  
[14:06] love this section of the day. Before the heat  and before too much exhaustion had set in.  
[14:24] 53 km in nearly 9 hours 31 minutes, we are  dropping down into this fantastic valley.
[14:34] It's just gorgeous. We've got a horrible long  climb back up when we get to the bottom here.  
[14:42] But then when we get to the top of that  long climb, there's a nice aid station.
[14:45] So that's the takeaway from that. Look at  this. It's a stunning but very technical  
[14:54] descent demanding your full attention,  which is incredibly difficult to do with  
[14:59] such interesting and inspiring scenery  around. The exertion of the climb back  
[15:05] up is tempered with the knowledge that  the next checkpoint is just at the top.  
[15:18] We could hear the music at the El Hornillo  aid station from way down in the valley,  
[15:22] and it was an early morning party  atmosphere When I finally reached the top,  
[15:38] Tempting as it was to stay longer, it was time to  cross the Los Peroz Dam and make my way up another  
[15:45] long climb through beautiful green forests against  a deep blue backdrop without a cloud in sight.
[15:53] The last time I ran Trans Gran Canaria.  It was this section which put paid to  
[15:57] many people's race. High up in the  mountains with the wind howling,  
[16:02] the rain and hail lashing down and  the temperatures below freezing.
[16:06] It could not have been more different this  time round. And I was very grateful to be  
[16:11] running down to Artenara in such perfect  conditions. What's your name? I'm Hasel.
[16:18] Hasel, I believe you did the Arc  of Attrition last month. I did,  
[16:23] yes. How did you do? What time did you  do for the 100? I finished in 34 hours.
[16:30] Fantastic. And here you are  doing Trans Gran Canaria. Yep.
[16:34] Is this your first time in Gran Canaria? It's  my first time, yes. What do you think of it so  
[16:39] far? It's a beautiful place and it's a good trail.  What are you hoping for today? Hoping to finish.
[16:47] You don't care what time? Good for  you. We're still on this climb up to  
[16:54] the top of the hill and then it's down  about 8km to Artenara aid station. And  
[17:04] that will be on my watch, 70k, but  no doubt less than that in the race.
[17:19] Hi there. Oh, I'm tired, but we'll get  there. Where are you from? Worthing.
[17:26] Worthing, yeah. Reached the top of  that climb. That was a long one.
[17:32] And it's not. It's not straight down to the next  aid station. There are a couple more ups as well.
[17:40] But let's start jogging and get down this hill.  
[17:44] Despite the unrelenting sun, there  was a coolness in the air from the  
[17:48] altitude which made life a little easier.  Although I was still pretty beat up by now.
[18:10] And that is Tenerife over there. That is the  highest mountain in Spain. Teide on Tenerife.
[18:17] Around 65k in 5k to go to the next aid  station. Another really energy sapping  
[18:34] climb and still not at Artenara aid station.  Somebody's just told us it's about a kilometer.
[18:45] I really hope so because my watch reckons  it's about 2k. But finally just got to  
[18:53] the top of that climb. It is absolutely beautiful.
[18:58] So tired and we're only just over halfway, so  the long way to go. Just gotta hope I can hang  
[19:06] on until the sun goes down and then we can  grind it out in the dark. Coming up to 70k.
[19:31] We have finally arrived at Artenara. I am very  much screwed. But we'll take some time here and  
[19:41] just regroup, get some food, get some drinks,  rest over at Parque del Sur in Maspalomas.
[20:01] As I was trudging to the halfway point. US runner  Caleb Olsen crossed the finish line in 12 hours  
[20:09] 17 minutes to win the 2025 Trans Gran Canaria  classic. After his finish fifth place finish at  
[20:16] Western States last year, he was closely followed  by the UK's Jonathan Albon, who came in second.
[20:23] Then Jonathan Albon's wife Henriette crossed  the line to win the women's race in 15 hours  
[20:29] and two minutes and she almost collapsed on the  finish line. Finally, our friend Mark Darbyshire,  
[20:35] who was ably crewed as always by his mother Helen,  finished in 13th place in 15 hours 27 minutes.  
[20:51] Right, I've spent about 10 or 15  minutes here, just needed to recover.
[20:56] 12.4km to the next aid station at Tejada.  We've got a bit of a climb and then it's  
[21:03] downhill again all the way into the town  and we have 59 kilometers left to go.
[21:12] Don't realise how hot it is actually when you're  running and I've just stepped out from the shade  
[21:18] into the heat and it is roasting. I had lots  of different things to drink there. A very kind  
[21:27] lady gave me some milk, but I also had loads of  orange juice before it, so my stomach is feeling  
[21:36] a little bit on edge, shall we say? So I need to  just walk the next bit to let my stomach settle.
[21:45] Less than 60k to go. That's good, isn't  it? So we are well over halfway through.  
[21:55] If you want to see me finish,  you're gonna have to subscribe.
[22:00] I'm not putting all this effort in for you not  to hit the subscribe button, so please do that  
[22:08] now and I'll get to the end for you. And big  thank you to the sponsors of today's video and  
[22:19] the short training series we did before Flying  Burrito shirts. Thank you very much to them.
[22:26] I'm wearing the yellow shirt  today. It's kind of my favourite,  
[22:29] but that's just because I've had it  the longest and it kind of matches  
[22:35] my HOKA Skyward X shoes as well. So  very happy to be wearing this today.
[22:44] Link in the description to  get one of your own with a  
[22:48] discount code. Right. Don't forget to subscribe.
[22:52] Go for it now. Thank you.  
[22:57] Higher and higher, we climbed through  the increasingly breathtaking terrain,  
[23:02] reaching around 1700 meters above sea level on  the ridge overlooking Tejeda in the valley below.
[23:26] Wow, look at that.  
[23:51] My watch has just ticked over to 80k around  50 miles. We have probably 48 to go though.
[24:05] 48k to go and it's half past four in the  afternoon. The sun definitely feels like  
[24:13] it's not quite as hot as it was at 2:00 this  afternoon, but it's still really warm. And I  
[24:22] am making my way down this snaking path  into Tejeda for much needed sustenance.
[24:36] Finally.  
[24:42] Okay, this is Tejeda aid station, but I need to  get out of here. Nice of Ben to come and meet me.
[24:47] Yeah, he said he was possibly going  to go and get me some milk to drink.  
[24:57] My foot's really hurting now. I'm not  sure I can make it to Garanon in time.
[25:02] I've got two hours, probably two hours, 20  minutes to get to Garanon. It's all uphill.  
[25:09] So here's the latest update.
[25:12] Just left Tejeda, and I got  a phone call from Victoria.
[25:22] She says, according to the race predictor  app, I'm not going to make it to the cutoff  
[25:31] at the next checkpoint. Now, there's some  confusion about what time the cutoff is,  
[25:36] but nevertheless, either way, the race  predictor thinks I'm not going to make  
[25:41] it. So, as you know, Sarah Place  is running and she's ahead of me.
[25:46] She's doing really well. But Ben Parkes is  in town and so I phoned Ben and I said I  
[25:53] put him in a really awful position.  I just said, should I call it now?  
[25:57] Because my foot is really hurting and it  looks like I might not make the cut off.
[26:04] And to be fair to him, he said, I cannot  make that decision for you. However,  
[26:08] Ben is going to be at Garanon, which is the  next aid station, about 7 km up the hill.  
[26:16] So if I do miss the cut off, Ben is very  kindly gonna take me back to the hotel.
[26:24] And if I do make the cutoff, then he's  very kindly bought me a bottle of milk,  
[26:30] which I've been gasping for.  Unfortunately, I had to leave  
[26:35] Tejeda before he could give it to me. But  if I make it to Garanon, I'll get it there.
[26:40] So I'm gonna try. My foot is now  really sore. I mean, to be fair,  
[26:47] it's a stupid idea this, but I'm gonna go.
[26:50] I'm gonna just. I'm gonna do it and see if I make  
[26:53] it. I probably won't make  it, but I'm going to try.
[26:57] And this is where my race became a battle  against cut off times. As darkness fell,  
[27:02] I would be fighting to reach every checkpoint,  so much so that my camera remained firmly in my  
[27:09] pocket for much of the rest of the race.  Just ticked over to 90km. And that means  
[27:27] we've done 5k since leaving Tejeda now it's  8k to Garanon, but as we've been finding out,  
[27:45] those tend not to be true and we  tend to be doing 1, 2 or 3k further.
[27:52] It's 7 o'clock in the evening. I've got an hour to  potentially do 3, 4K. That's if cut off is at 8.
[28:03] If it's at 8, 15, we've got a bit  more of a chance. But we are now  
[28:09] on the really technical difficulty, climbing.  
[28:25] I made it to Garanon with  about 10 minutes to spare.
[28:28] I'm gonna grab some coffee,  then I'm gonna go and just  
[28:33] see if we can make it to the end now. I am  so tired. So I haven't filmed for a while.
[28:43] I can't remember the last time I filmed. I think  it was just to say that I'd managed to arrive at.  
[28:53] Oh, I can't remember the name of the aid station.
[28:57] Anyway, I got there with moments to spare and  then it's been moments to spare at the last  
[29:06] aid station as well. I didn't film. I had to run  in, had about five minutes to grab some drinks  
[29:15] and then out again.
[29:17] And apparently Ben says that I am expected to  arrive at the final aid station one minute after  
[29:29] cut off. So I'm trying to push as hard as I can to  make sure that that doesn't happen. But I realised  
[29:39] I hadn't given you an update in a while, so I  thought I'd better just film something quickly.
[29:44] But I am just going to concentrate  on finishing this race now. Filming,  
[29:50] I think will have to come  second. I'm sure you understand.
[29:56] I'm so tired. My leg is. My foot is  really sore and I just want to go to bed.
[30:05] But I have 22km left. Arrived at the  Final Aid Station, Ayguares. 14km to go.
[30:17] This has been such hard work.  The hardest one I've done on  
[30:22] this course. Just ridiculous,  chasing cutoffs all the time.
[30:30] But we. We've made it. Third time.
[30:33] Third time. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:36] I'm done with it now, though.  What's your name? Ellie. Ellie.
[30:44] Thanks for being there, Ellie.  No problem. Really appreciate it.
[30:46] Bit of British support for the Brits. Are you  
[30:50] doing this next year? I am going to do  the Advanced next year. Good for you.
[30:53] Yesterday. Well, I might. I'll try to  send my wife to do the Advanced next year.
[31:04] It has been half fought. It has been hard fought  this run. We are about 4k from the finish line.
[31:18] We're still wandering through these them  stones in the dry riverbed. But I'm fairly  
[31:27] confident that in about a kilometer the  stones will disappear and it'll open out.  
[31:39] I'm hoping Victoria and the kids are  going to wake up to come and see me.
[31:44] It is 4 o'clock in the morning.  
[31:51] Well, how good does that feel at Tejeda,  
[31:56] I really wasn't sure I was gonna finish this.  The second half of that race was horrendous.
[32:07] But when the chips are down,  you just have to focus and get  
[32:11] the job done. And we are about to  cross the finish line of the Trans  
[32:16] Gran Canaria Classic for the third  time. And that is a job well done.
[32:36] Film my run. What's your name, mate? Stephen.  It's Stephen filming himself finishing here.
[32:45] Congratulations. Thank you, buddy.  I crossed the line with over an hour  
[32:50] to spare before cutoff in one of the most  satisfying finishes I've ever had in a race.
[32:58] Very, very pleased with that.  That took some doing. That did.
[33:05] I've been waiting a long time to have a latte.  
[33:08] 29 hours. In fact, I made it just  under 29 hours, so 28 something.
[33:15] Do you know what? Absolutely delighted with  that, to be honest, given the preparation,  
[33:20] the injury and. And the hot  weather today. It was warm.
[33:27] Anyway, I'll do a full breakdown of. Of the  run and how it all went in a different video,  
[33:34] but for now, thank you very much for watching.  Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already,  
[33:41] and take care and I'll see you  on the start line next time.
