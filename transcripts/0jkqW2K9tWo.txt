==================================================

[00:00] Supporting grassroots running,  this is the Steyning Stinger.  
[00:03] We've done this many times before,  and we're going to jog round again.
[00:07] I'm supposed to be in, like, the top end of  marathon training at the moment, but it's  
[00:11] not happening. I've been ill, as you know. So,  we're just going to jog around this and have fun.
[00:16] We've got to negotiate this  puddle first. Hi there. Thank you.
[00:20] So, the Steyning Stinger, if you remember,  
[00:22] is the run that there's no. Well, there is  a start, but it's a rolling start. You can  
[00:28] just start whenever you want between  07:00 and nine or something like that.
[00:32] Anyway, so we just rock up, park in the car park,  
[00:37] and get on with it. Beautiful morning. It's cold,  but it looks like the sun is going to come out.
[00:45] There's blue skies. There's some  lovely mist over the river over there,  
[00:51] so it's going to be a gorgeous run. 7:35.
[01:00] We're going to start, so let's  go. We cross the timing mat,  
[01:03] press our watches, and we are off. That's it.
[01:10] So, we're going to take this very easy  today because, as I say, I am not fit.  
[01:16] Nowhere near. It's also liable to  be very, very muddy on the course.
[01:23] It's been wet for a good few weeks, not like  last year. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[01:34] Mud. Mud free for about a  kilometre way in the first 2 km,  
[01:51] just coming off the road. All right, Gaz.
[01:54] Hi, Steve. How you doing? I'm very well. Gaz,  
[01:58] organiser of Richmond Park  and so many other events.
[02:04] I must come and do Richmond Park Marathon again,  actually. It's such a lovely run. 19 May, Steve.
[02:09] 19 May. If you want to do Richmond Park  Marathon. Absolutely gorgeous marathon.
[02:14] Haven't done it for years, but, yeah,  get yourself down there. And also the  
[02:18] Vanguard Way Marathon, August the fourth,  for Gaz's Vanguard Way Marathon as well. Yes.
[02:28] So normally we follow the road all the  way up to Wiston House, but today we're  
[02:35] on this newly laid path. Right, that's 3  km in, in just over 20 minutes. 21 minutes.
[02:43] We're going through the farm.  Beautiful. With the sun behind us.
[02:47] I'm running with Dimi, and we're about to start  a very long muddy section in a minute. I mean,  
[02:57] it's been muddy already, but this is going to  be something else in a minute. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:01] No, it's really, really bad. So, what do you think  of it so far, Sharon? Great. Lots of lovely mud.
[03:16] Just what we like. See, you just said to me,  
[03:18] that normally you would do Brighton  Marathon. This is a bit different.
[03:22] Bit different, yes. I'm getting old  now. I've got to move to the trails.
[03:27] Enjoy your race. Thank you. See you guys.
[03:29] Bye-bye. All right, we are five k in 35  minutes and we're just climbing. Long,  
[03:46] long climb in a minute to  the top of the South Downs.
[03:51] Up and downy at the moment, very muddy.  It's cold, but when you're running,  
[03:57] it's absolutely fine. If anything,  I feel a bit hot in my jumper here.
[04:10] North Downs over there. Beautiful.  With the mist just below the hills.
[04:23] Now, believe it or not, this is an airfield  here. So, this strip of grass is an airfield.  
[04:31] The farmer in there owns a plane and he takes  off from this strip of grass just down here.
[04:38] You can't see it through there, can  you, really? But it's a biplane,  
[04:42] I think, and you can quite often be seen  flying over the South Downs. How are you,  
[04:49] Mark? I'm all right, I'm all  right. I'm struggling a bit today.
[04:52] I've got a bit of a throat today,  but we're all good. Perennial marathon  
[04:57] runner. You've seen Mark on many  of my videos, but I don't think  
[05:00] I've slipped the camera in his face for a  few years. Not outside the bedroom
[05:03] anyway, Stephen. That's not  going to make it in! So, Mark,  
[05:08] tell everyone how many marathons  you've now done. It's only two
[05:12] three, three today, I think.
[05:13] Only 233 marathons. That's rubbish. It's rubbish.
[05:16] Needs to pull his finger out.  Compared to Dave Lewis and Steve,  
[05:20] I'm a novice. Right, we're seven k in 48 minutes.
[05:24] 49 minutes. We're just going through  the little village of Washington here,  
[05:29] and then we'll climb up onto  the South Downs. Cheers, Mark.
[05:33] Cheers, mate. Hello, Mr. How's  it going? Just over 5 miles,  
[05:45] climbing up this big hill now  to the top of the South Downs.
[05:52] And when we get to the top, beautiful views down  into Washington and Steyning and all over to the  
[05:58] North Downs Way. Look at that, eh? Beautiful.  And me and Mark have run all the way up.
[06:13] Ten k in 1 hour. Ten minutes,  
[06:18] top of the downs. We're about to turn  back and head towards Chanctonbury.
[06:23] To be fair, me and Mark both wanted  to stop and walk on that hill,  
[06:29] but we were too full of testosterone. Right,  
[06:58] this is Callum. Callum's angry with me  because last year we filmed this event.
[07:04] Have a look up there. I'll link it up  there. And it was the driest on record.
[07:09] And Callum and his mate said, oh, that  looks a breeze, that does. And of course,  
[07:14] how are you finding it? It's a lot more  difficult than your video suggested. I  
[07:19] saw you and I was like, I need  to put a formal complaint in.
[07:22] It's the only reason we signed up to look so  nice. Five k and we're walking up hills like  
[07:28] Everest. But now tell me though, how many  marathons have you done? It's my first one.
[07:33] You've never even done a trail race before.  Never done a trail race before. So there you go.
[07:38] An experience. Well, good luck. Enjoy.
[07:42] Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you.
[07:57] I can't resist a bit of chocolate. First bit of  
[08:01] chocolate of the day. 13 and a  half k in hour and a half done.
[08:09] 1 hour 31 minutes. We are 10 miles into the  Steyning Stinger marathon. 1 hour 51 minutes.
[08:22] Just coming to the top of the climb up to  Chanctonbury Ring. The sun is out, we're  
[08:30] having a beautiful day. We're not going quick,  but we don't care, do we, Mark? No, we don't care.
[08:38] Talk about enjoying yourself, having  a good chat. Right, here's the point  
[08:50] in the race where if you have decided to do the  marathon, but then you're absolutely shattered,  
[08:56] you can just go straight that way and  do the half. And if you think, well,  
[09:01] I could do the full marathon, but I'm not  quite up to it, you can go and do the 30.
[09:07] So you have a choice, even it doesn't  matter what marathon or what run you've  
[09:12] signed up for. You can decide whilst you're  running whether you want to do the half the  
[09:19] full. So I think I'm quite happy to  carry on with the full at the moment.
[09:24] So we'll go this way. Nice little bit of downhill  
[09:28] coming up. Now we're going to go  down the hill to Cissbury Ring.
[09:31] So we've just come from Chanctonbury Ring.  Now we're going to go down to Cissbury  
[09:34] Ring and we are 18 km in 2 hours.  These boys are going the easy way.
[09:44] Sit down, sport, that is. Have  a good one, guys. Let's be done.
[09:50] Hello, Andy. All right, looks  like the 30K turnaround is here,  
[10:14] but we have a little loop to do. We're  going to go down and then back up what's  
[10:20] called Cardiac Hill to get to the top of  Cissbury Ring, which is this hill here.
[10:26] And then it's back off towards Steyning. And  we've got another little loop to do around  
[10:32] Steep Down before we get to the finish.  So we're just coming up to 13 miles.
[10:37] So not nearly halfway now. We've now done 21  minutes, so it looks like a finish of around 4:45,  
[10:52] which would be an hour slower than last year.  You lot of guys doing their Duke of Edinburgh.
[11:05] Well done, guys. Tom, is this  your first time doing this race?  
[11:13] It certainly is. But you're from Worthing? Yes.
[11:16] What have you been doing all  this time? Injured. This is like  
[11:19] redemption. And you've got what coming  up as well? Well, Three Fort, hopefully.
[11:24] Nice. Yeah. And then maybe the Beachy Head.
[11:28] Oh, you're not going easy on the  marathons then? Have a good one.  
[11:42] Nicola, what's your running club?  We're Harvel Hash House Harriers.
[11:46] And why are you here? Because I love trail  running. This is your first time doing this one?  
[11:51] Yeah, but there's a big gang of you, isn't there?  Yeah. There's nine of us here from the pub today.
[11:57] Yes, we're working our way up. We've  got the Lakeland in summer. Oh, gosh.
[12:01] Early training for that.  Fantastic. Well, have a good one.
[12:04] Thank you. They're 25 km in, so 10 miles to go,  
[12:22] 16 km left, 16-17 ish. And we've  done that in 2 hours 44 minutes.
[12:30] So we're not breaking any records today,  
[12:32] but we don't care. It's a beautiful day,  the sun's out, the birds are singing,  
[12:38] and we're climbing up Cardiac Hill to get to the  top of Cissbury Ring. How's it going? Smashing.
[13:06] Easy work, isn't it? Oh, yeah. It's  28 km in 3 hours and six minutes.
[13:19] Feeling it now, just starts to ache in  my neck and my back, but we'll get this  
[13:24] done. Got really warm climbing the last hill, so  we're now down to the vest. Gloves off, hat off.
[13:31] Still enjoying it. Hi there. They're lovely.
[13:41] You're supposed to bring your own cup, which  I forgot to do. Well done, buddy. I either  
[13:47] get somebody to pour a jug into my mouth or  I don't have any water for the entire run.
[13:53] Let's see how far I can get.  Cheers, buddy. Thank you.
[13:57] All right, matey. This is not fun.  What, are you on the marathon? No.
[14:02] Eighteen. Thirty k. Thirty k.
[14:04] Oh, you turn around up there. Yeah. And come back.
[14:07] Nice. I'm done. Not long to go.
[14:11] How's it going? Cheers, bud.  So I said I forgot my cup,  
[14:20] but thankfully there are one or two cups,  so we've got a little loop to do of Steep  
[14:29] Down now and then we come back here and then  it's just 3 miles up to the finish. 30k done.
[14:40] 3 hours, 25 minutes so this loop around,  
[14:45] Steepdown and then we just got a big climb  and there's a long downhill all the way to  
[14:53] the finish. That seems a little way off just  yet though. Starting to tire quite a lot.
[15:01] Hips, back, legs aching. But  this is the first long run  
[15:04] I've done in months. So not a surprise, really.
[15:21] Yes, buddy. Thank you. It's interesting  to contrast this year with last year.
[15:52] So I've just hit 20 miles in 3 hours 38  minutes. So let's just interject a little  
[16:01] bit of video from last year when I  reached this point. There we are.
[16:06] That is 20 miles done in 2 hours 50 minutes.  So we've got 10k to go and if I want to do  
[16:14] it in under 4 hours, I've got an hour and ten  minutes to do 10k. So let's go and do this thing.
[16:22] Feeling okay? Feeling pretty good. It was a lot  
[16:27] drier last year and I was a  lot fitter. So there we go.
[16:34] Anyway, 6 miles to go, 10k, let's  get it. And we're back at the aid  
[17:23] station. So we've been round, Steepdown, we've got about 7k to go.
[17:29] Thank you. Yeah, definitely suffering today  though. Even though it's a beautiful day,  
[17:34] it's just really hard going underfoot.
[17:37] And when you are a bit underfit then  yeah, it takes its toll. Thank you  
[17:44] so much for that. Thank you for being here.
[17:47] Cheers, guys. Over the timing  mat. And we have just 6k to go.
[17:55] Seven k to go. See, it affects your brain as  well. Four and a half hours in nearly 38k.
[18:35] Not quite 38k. So yeah,  
[18:41] about 4k to go. But I have crashed and  burned now I can't bring myself to run.
[18:49] I mean, it's gorgeous, isn't it?  You can see what a lovely day it  
[18:52] is. But that's me done for today. I am shattered.
[18:59] It's a big downhill so obviously I'll run  that downhill when we get there. But yeah,  
[19:07] crashed and burned now. It's all good though.
[19:09] We love it. Glad I did it. Glad I'm here.
[19:18] James, how have you found it today? Muddy,  tough, but what I needed to do. Yeah, what have  
[19:25] you got coming up? Hundred Hills in a couple of  weeks. So this is my last training run for that.
[19:30] How far is the Hundred Hills? 50k.  Nice one. Well, good luck with that.
[19:34] Cheers. Didn't stop at this aid station last year,  
[19:39] but I wasn't so knackered this time  last year. Thanks for being there guys.
[19:49] Appreciate it. Bit of chocolate, glass  and a half of water and 2 miles to  
[20:02] go down the hill. To the finish,  which I will be very glad to see.
[20:16] Down we go. Could be very slippy. Just hit 40k.
[20:32] We've got about ten minutes to get in  if we want to do it under 5 hours. I  
[20:36] don't think that's going to happen. I  don't think I can do 2k in ten minutes.
[20:42] Legs are so tired. 4 hours  52 minutes 40. I'm so tired.
[21:02] 5 hours. We've done 41. Got about  a kilometre and a bit to go.
[21:10] This is actually going to be for the first  time ever, it's going to be over a marathon  
[21:14] distance. So well done to the Steyning Stinger  and well done to the Steyning Athletics Club  
[21:20] for getting this distance. Pretty much bang on  and very good signposting as well this year.
[21:29] Really well signposted marshals as  well in lots of new places and yeah,  
[21:36] slightly different route which meant that, yeah,  we are definitely going to hit over 42km if I can  
[21:44] get through this last bit of mud. Thoroughly  enjoyed it though, as always. Try and run.
[21:52] I've got so much mud clogged into my boots, into  my shoes. Well, there is literally no let up in  
[22:01] the mud right to the very end here. I think  even if I was on top form and feeling fast,  
[22:08] there's no way I'd have got anywhere near last  year's time with conditions underfoot like this.
[22:13] I mean, glorious up above, but  absolutely diabolical down below.  
[22:36] From my fastest Steyning Stinger last year  to my slowest Steyning Stinger this year,  
[22:43] we're going to cross the line in 5 hours and  eleven minutes. Wow, that was hard work today.
[22:53] Thank you. Done thoroughly enjoyed  that. Once again, completely shattered.
[23:07] But yeah, Steyning Stinger is always a great  run. Whether it's dry, whether it's muddy,  
[23:12] whether it's blowing a gale and windy, or whether  it's sunny like today. Gorgeous day today.
[23:19] So now if you want to, you  can go and have breakfast in  
[23:23] the old grammar school. Steyning  Grammar School. And it's free.
[23:29] Paid for by your entry. Sausages, beans,  scrambled egg, all sorts. Thank you very much.
[23:40] Thank you. Yes. So here's where you  get your exciting breakfast vest.
[23:48] Did you beat me again? No. If you want  to watch last year's Steyning Stinger  
[23:57] where I did an hour and 20 minutes  faster, then click that link right  
[24:03] there and I'll see you on the start  line next time. Take care everyone.
