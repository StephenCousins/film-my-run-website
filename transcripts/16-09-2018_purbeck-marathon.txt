[06:09] you know those races where you start off
[06:13] really strong I'm going alright here and
[06:16] you start passing loads of people and
[06:18] then you get to halfway and then
[06:21] everything drops away your motivation
[06:24] goes your momentum goes yes leave goes I
[06:29] had one Thursday today I thought for me
[06:34] I thought I'd go out a bit fast at the
[06:35] beginning in trying doing the first half
[06:37] of the marathon in two hours and see if
[06:40] I could hold onto there well it turns
[06:42] out I couldn't hold on and again you
[06:45] know that feeling where at the end of a
[06:47] race everyone is coming past you it's
[06:50] not a good feeling of it one by one
[06:52] people are catching you up so you know
[06:58] you win some you lose some
[07:00] today it was a pretty pretty brutal it
[07:04] has to be said but that is the perfect
[07:07] method I've got a thing for the perfect
[07:09] mouthing now I need to come back I need
[07:10] to try and do this better each time I've
[07:14] done it I've got slower but it's still
