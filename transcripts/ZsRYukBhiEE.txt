==================================================

[00:26] OK, 5Ks, 10Ks, half marathons and  marathons—basically anything short  
[00:30] and fast—is over and done with  for 2025, apart from parkrun,  
[00:35] of course. Heading into the summer, it's  time for the long stuff. Starting with  
[00:40] the Ridgeway Challenge, a 140-kilometre  race along the entire Ridgeway Trail,  
[00:46] from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire  to Avebury Stone Circle in Wiltshire.
[00:51] Runaway Racing have taken it over for this  year, but there is this long history of the  
[00:56] race going back 20 years. I've wanted to do  the full Ridgeway for quite a long time and  
[01:04] I'm very excited to start at Ivinghoe Beacon. A  variety of companies had run this event before.
[01:11] It's been run 20 times now, but  Runaway Racing have taken it over  
[01:15] this year. So let's get going.  It's a little bit of a climb.
[01:18] We're all walking to the start,  which is about 600–700 metres,  
[01:22] and then up a hill to the top of Ivinghoe  Beacon, which is the start of the Ridgeway.  
[01:29] What a start line at this place this year.  The Ridgeway Challenge has been chosen as  
[01:36] the ultra distance race for the British Trail  Running Championships, and one of my goals for  
[01:42] the race was to try and challenge for an age  group podium place. Beautiful start location.
[02:03] We set off from one of the most picturesque race  start locations we were ever likely to encounter,  
[02:09] to begin an adventure which would see  us follow in the footsteps of herdsmen,  
[02:14] traders, travellers and soldiers from  Neolithic and Celtic tribes, right through  
[02:19] the Roman and medieval periods, to when it  was established as a National Trail in 1972.
[02:27] “So what's the idea with both  wearing matching shoes then?”
[02:31] “I know! It was an accidental choice, that was.”
[02:34] “We didn't go out with that plan.”
[02:35] “You almost got the same T-shirt as well!”
[02:39] Oh, it's lovely along here, isn't it? We climbed  Pitstone Hill and passed Pitstone Quarry,  
[02:46] leaving Buckinghamshire briefly behind  to pass by Tring Railway Station before  
[02:51] heading back into Buckinghamshire  along the Chiltern escarpment.
[03:01] “Andrew, why did you choose this one  then? It's your furthest run ever.”
[03:07] “A friend of mine's doing it. He's  way up ahead. He picks the ultras,  
[03:10] and I kind of go, ‘Yeah, OK,  I'll do that one as well.’”
[03:33] One  
[03:34] hour, 59 minutes into the Ridgeway Challenge  and 10 miles done. So it's about right—five  
[03:42] miles an hour or so. It's been a mixture  of shaded woodland like we're in now and  
[03:48] open countryside where we're exposed to  the heat of the sun. It is warm today.
[03:58] “I'm about to a four-year-old's birthday party.”
[04:02] “That is exactly right actually. A  four-year-old's birthday party is what we have.”
[04:06] My favourite biscuit—party rings. Food of  the gods on an ultra is a Jaffa Cake. And  
[04:14] I mean, some people like these, but what the heck?
[04:17] “Thank you guys. Have fun. Enjoy.”
[04:20] On we go.
[04:23] St Mary's Church here at 18 kilometres has a  15th-century tower and roots dating back to  
[04:29] the 12th century. It signified our approach  to the town of Wendover on the Heron Path.
[04:45] So, crewing is more than just crewing. We've had  to buy socks. Now to go and buy ice and milk.  
[05:04] So I was 16 in and we're in Wendover—18 and a  half kilometres. Gail behind me and I have agreed  
[05:19] that we don't think the ancient Britons walked  this way. They're building HS2 just down there.  
[05:29] This bridge is brand new. A bit of a  diversion off the Ridgeway. 19K in.
[05:42] And so began the long climb up to the top  of Coombe Hill and the Coombe Hill Monument,  
[05:48] erected in 1904 to commemorate those who  died during the Second Boer War (1899–1902).
[06:14] “That's cruel, that is. Steepest hill of the race  so far. Let's hope there's not too many of these.”
[06:35] Gorgeous up here. Don't know how long we  can cope in this heat though. It might  
[06:41] not be that warm if you're just sitting on  the top of the ridge there and looking out,  
[06:46] but when you're trying to run or  climb uphill, it's pretty warm.
[06:55] “Hi Paul, you go away with your  bus. Right, not on my list.”
[07:02] Two hours, 35 minutes—27  and a bit K. Checkpoint two.
[07:09] “Thank you very much indeed. Coca-Cola  is what I'd like in there please.”
[07:15] “Indeed, indeed. Thank you.”
[07:32] We're waiting here in a layby at  approximately 34 kilometres. I  
[07:39] believe this is between checkpoints  two and three. It's quite hot. We've  
[07:45] been off and purchased ice and freeze pops.  Hopefully that will help cool Stephen down.  
[07:54] Runners are saying it really is hot out on  course, but it’s a beautiful day for crewing.
[08:17] Four hours, 38 minutes,  
[08:22] and approaching the meeting point with  my wife at 34 kilometres. Suffering in  
[08:32] the heat of course—it's hot. I'm trying to  just conserve energy and run where I can.
[08:41] In fact, I can see my wife.  
[08:47] Right, I've got ice in my backpack and  I've got a fruit pop thing. See you later.
[08:55] “Where am I going?”
[08:56] “Oh, yeah, there. All right. See you later.”
[09:00] It was warm and humid by now, and  the ice bandana definitely helped,  
[09:04] but I can't say it was sweltering.  
[09:16] We're at 47 kilometres in—that's between  checkpoints three and four. Stephen is  
[09:24] struggling in this heat—it’s expected with  him. It's my job to keep his head in the game.  
[09:35] He had tea—a milky hue—what else did  he have? He had a Mission Hydration  
[09:44] sachet and an ice pop when we saw him  last, and we’re just patiently waiting.
[09:51] So the thing about crewing is it’s quite  intense in the sense that you have to get  
[09:57] to the point where you've agreed to meet your  runner, you need to have everything ready for  
[10:04] when they arrive—and also a selection of things,  because what they think they’re going to want at  
[10:10] the next checkpoint isn’t necessarily what they  actually want when they get to you. So lots of  
[10:16] sitting around, I chat to other people crewing  and generally try to stay relaxed and wait.
[10:31] I don’t know if you can see that, but  according to my watch I have less than  
[10:36] 100K to go—so 62 miles left. I think  it's just cooling down a little bit.  
[10:47] The ice in my bandana here is helping,  but I am just managing expectations.
[10:58] It's so hot for me. For you—wherever  you're watching—it's probably, you know,  
[11:04] 20 degrees, 22 degrees—nothing. But for  me, it feels like I'm boiling in an oven,  
[11:11] so forgive me. But I'm just gonna… I'm having to  walk a load and just not worry about how fast I'm  
[11:20] going. I know I'm way ahead of the cut-off,  so that's nothing to worry about. Just need  
[11:25] to put one foot in front of the other until it  gets cold enough that I can run from here on.
[11:32] I will be in familiar territory as I've run both  the Centurion Autumn 100 and Race to the Stones,  
[11:39] which cover the rest of the  Ridgeway from this point on.
[11:43] I'm feeling the heat, but it’s a warm  one today, isn’t it? Get your drinks.
[11:47] Six hours and seven minutes—it’s taken me to  do a marathon. 42.2 kilometres on the watch.  
[11:54] Just been to checkpoint three and now, in about  5K, I will meet Victoria. If it cools down,  
[12:03] I feel like I’ll be able to get some running  in. At the moment, it’s like 100 metres running,  
[12:12] 200 metres walking—that kind of thing.  But we’re all right. We’ll get this done.
[12:40] So I’ve got a small selection of snacks  here. I have made a delicious cream cheese,  
[12:50] Marmite and cucumber bagel. Marmite crisps. A cup  of Earl Grey tea. Banana. Grapes. Brazil nuts.  
[13:04] And a little can of tonic water. Probably don’t  want that. And if he wants, he can wash his hands.
[13:10] OK, time to meet the wife again. Just under 92  kilometres left to go. Here’s the Film My Run van.
[13:19] “Hello!”
[13:21] Every time I’ve seen the dog’s  problem, I’ve been like, “Oh,  
[13:30] last time I was in the middle of the  first time…” That was—that’s better.
[13:32] “Good.”
[13:32] That’s what other runners are  saying—it’s starting to cool down.
[13:35] “Yeah, a little bit, yeah.”
[13:37] I think I might bagel-crisp. I think I  might take another ice bandana though.
[13:43] “Yeah, I’ve got one already just for this  section, and then maybe we’ll be all right.”
[13:53] “How’s it going?”
[13:54] “Do you want to put that  in a mug? Is that better?”
[13:58] “Don’t mind.”
[14:00] OK, on our way again with a packet  of Marmite crisps. Had milk. Had  
[14:08] a cup of tea. Had a few red grapes. Can’t really  
[14:12] stomach much more in this weather. Got  another ice bandana on and away we go.
[14:18] 47.5K—so I’ll see Victoria again at 60K.  We've got another aid station in between.
[14:53] So that is Swyncombe Church. That means we have  12 miles to go to get to Goring and Streatley, and  
[15:04] it’s about 3K to the next checkpoint—checkpoint  four on the Ridgeway Challenge. It’s  
[15:13] about quarter to six in the evening. I’ve still  got an ice pack on. It’s still pretty warm here.
[15:19] I think next time I see Victoria,  I won’t get another ice pack.  
[15:23] Hopefully it’ll have cooled down  enough by then not to need one.
[15:29] ♪ "You take me to the outside for you, walk with  me on your miles / Explain why you broke down,  
[15:49] yeah, explain why you broke down / What  I did wrong took me by surprise..." ♪
[16:20] “Oh, it’s Steve from the film!”
[16:22] “Hello there! How are you?”
[16:22] “How are you doing?”
[16:24] Yes, it's tough. You've got your Burrito shirt on.
[16:33] This section of the Ridgeway Trail is some  of the most peaceful—almost enchanting—as  
[16:38] it winds along Grim’s Ditch, a linear  prehistoric earthwork dating back to the  
[16:43] Bronze Age. Just like running on the South  Downs Way, you can feel the history under  
[16:49] your feet and the weight of time on your  shoulders as you run these amazing trails.
[17:07] So whilst crewing, it’s really important  to look after yourself. Easier said than  
[17:13] done. You're so focused on looking after  your runner that you can easily neglect  
[17:19] yourself. I’m currently having a  cup of tea and some fruit platter.
[17:26] “And here he is!”
[17:29] “You’re having fun?”
[17:30] “Yeah, very well done.”
[17:33] “All right.”
[17:33] “Yeah, you?”
[17:34] “Fan’s on the left.”
[17:35] “Oh yeah.”
[17:57] It’s a beautiful evening now, and it’s much,  
[17:59] much cooler. And if you haven’t  subscribed to the channel yet,  
[18:05] you need to see me do the other half—and I’m not  going to do the other half unless you subscribe.
[18:11] “So I am gonna. I am gonna do it. All right.  But please do still subscribe to the channel.”
[18:16] I want to say a massive thank you to the  two sponsors of the video today. First,  
[18:22] Enertor Insoles, who have supplied me with just  the most comfortable insoles to put in my shoes  
[18:29] for the last six years. Absolutely love them—use  them in all my shoes. Do go and check out the link  
[18:35] in the description to get some money off some  of your own. So thank you very much to Enertor.
[18:43] And is it weird that I’m going to plug my shirt  sponsor, Flying Burrito, without actually wearing  
[18:51] the Flying Burrito shirt? It got so wet with all  the ice and the sweat. I changed it at the last  
[19:00] crew stop, so it’s drying out in the van. I’m  going to be putting it on again later when it’s  
[19:04] dry. Thank you so much to Flying Burrito for  the awesome-looking shirt. Love that shirt.  
[19:11] I don’t know why I didn’t bring two with me—like  an idiot. But anyway, there we are. Again, link in  
[19:16] the description below if you want to get yourself  a Flying Burrito shirt with some money off.
[19:26] This is very pretty. Look at this  little cabin there, right by the  
[19:31] water’s edge here—look, that’s gorgeous, isn’t it?
[19:39] 65.38 kilometres done in 10 hours and 11 minutes.
[19:57] “How far is it to Goring now?”
[19:59] “To Goring? Yeah, Goring’s probably  only about 3 kilometres away from here.”
[20:04] “Right, I’m not gonna come in.  I’m just gonna go to Goring.”
[20:07] “Oh no, but you’re not gonna see the  chapel! What are you putting out?”
[20:09] “No, no, I’m gonna meet my wife  in Goring. She’s crewing me.”
[20:13] “OK, you’re carrying it, but  you’re not stopping here.”
[20:15] “I’m not.”
[20:15] “Get you.”
[20:16] “Sorry. Off you go.”
[20:35] So it’s 9:00 p.m. We are at Goring Village  Hall. Stephen's about a kilometre away. He  
[20:44] wants soup, a cold latte, and two paracetamol.  He did look a bit brighter though the last  
[20:53] time we saw him. He said that the  weather was starting to cool down.
[21:05] “Do you need me to dry your cap?”
[21:08] “No, it’s dry.”
[21:09] “OK, it’s fine. You’ve got a dry shirt.”
[21:13] “Oh, that’s nice. I really,  
[21:15] really need paracetamol. My back  is aching, my legs are killing me.”
[21:19] “Cheers, buddy.”
[21:21] “All well, mate?”
[21:21] “Yeah, yeah. No, I’m struggling now. It’s  like a bit mental because it’s like… oh,  
[21:28] I’m only halfway through, you know  what I mean? But you know the score.”
[21:34] “I know the score, yeah.”
[21:41] Right, 71 kilometres in. This is Goring over  there. We’re just crossing the River Thames and  
[21:49] Streatley is just ahead of us there. So we’re  now going to head up—there’s a bit of a climb,  
[21:57] so I’ve put my poles in my quiver and we’re  going to climb up. We’re on the Ridgeway,  
[22:05] but yeah, there’s a bit of a  climb up to the ridge again now.
[22:12] Feeling better for stopping and seeing  Victoria, definitely. 11 hours 23 minutes,  
[22:28] 71K. So we’re over halfway. Going  nice and slow. I’m stiff, I’m aching,  
[22:36] but I’ve just had paracetamol, so that should  help. Head torch will go on in a minute.  
[22:43] I’ve had a bit of chicken soup, I’ve  had a cold latte and paracetamol.
[23:04] It’s 11:37 p.m. We are 83 kilometres  in and Stephen is approaching.
[23:16] “And here he is!”
[23:17] “Oh, that’s you! You’ve  got a different jacket on.”
[23:22] “For me it’s getting really cold, but I’m  guessing it’s perfect temperature for you?”
[23:26] “Just about, yeah. I am a little nippy,  but… Did the poles help for that?”
[23:35] “Yeah, definitely. Definitely.”
[23:38] “Right.”
[23:40] “Do you know what? I’ve done that—I  mean, this lady’s been behind me—but  
[23:45] I’ve done that all on my own. There’s  nobody around. She marches so quick.”
[23:54] “Right. Have a rile... a rile... Can’t even  talk. Have a relax, a rest, something.”
[24:02] By now, any hopes I had of getting that podium  position in my age group were fading fast.
[24:09] Five-minute power nap.
[24:14] 14 hours and five minutes, and we’ve got  54 kilometres left to go. According to my  
[24:22] watch I’ve done 86K, but I’ve just been  to a checkpoint back there and that was  
[24:29] supposed to be at 83K—so I’ve got  two kilometres extra on my watch.
[24:37] It’s a bit colder up here now, so I’ve got  my fleece on. Well, it’s not my fleece—it’s  
[24:43] Victoria’s fleece, actually, because mine was  soaking wet. So I’ve got a fleece on and again,  
[24:50] I’m just marching, marching it out. But do you  know what? 54K to go. I know it sounds a lot,  
[24:59] but actually, we are getting there.  We are definitely getting there.
[25:07] Don’t feel good. Wish it was over. But, you know,  we’ve done this before. We’ve been here before.  
[25:14] We’ve had this pain before. We’ve had these  mental challenges before. And we will get it done.
[25:33] I feel like I’m in an episode of An American  Werewolf in London because over in the forest  
[25:43] there is the most horrendously frightening  noise. I’m just going to be quiet and see  
[25:48] if it does it... And you can hear—I’ll  try and make it louder on the video. It’s  
[26:05] a scary noise. He’s been constantly at it  for the last 10 minutes as I’ve approached.
[26:15] We are just at Chain Hill.
[26:29] “How are you feeling, mister?”
[26:31] “Tired.”
[26:35] “Well, it’s to be expected.”
[26:39] “Yeah, I’m enjoying my little naps in the van.”
[26:45] And there are 45 kilometres left to go.  So we’ll get there. You’re doing great.  
[26:55] You just got to get some more calories into  you and then you’ll have some more energy.
[27:02] After 16 hours and 26 minutes, we’ve reached  one of the main milestones of any ultra race:  
[27:10] a marathon to go. 42K left. So just  running where I can, marching it out  
[27:25] mostly. But on the downhills, I am able to  run a little bit. It’s not very fast, but—I  
[27:36] mean—I feel a whole heap better  than I did when the sun was out.  
[27:41] Massively better. But I’m still not able to  run very fast. Just can’t get my legs moving.
[27:52] I feel like I want to have a nap every time I  
[27:57] see Victoria. Just get in the  van and rest for five minutes.  
[28:07] Didn’t have a very good night’s sleep last night,  to be fair. But yeah, just tired. Really tired.
[28:21] I reached 100 kilometres in 16 hours  and 47 minutes. Given how much I moan  
[28:27] about running in the heat, it actually got  quite cold in the early part of the morning,  
[28:31] with a biting wind on the ridge. I was very  glad to see the sunrise, and it perked me  
[28:37] up just enough to consider pushing that  little bit harder for that podium position.
[28:46] 26K to go. 19 hours and 35 minutes, and  I’m just meeting Victoria in the van.
[28:59] “Right. Right, I’ve had a coffee,  I’ve got a banana, that’s it.”
[29:06] “Oh, I need my poles, and then I’m off.”
[29:09] “All right. See you later.”
[29:13] OK, down the road. My feet are very, very  sore—primarily because I forgot to bring  
[29:28] my socks that always work for me, and we had  to buy some socks which are not the greatest.
[29:38] It’s around here that the Ridgeway runs parallel  to—and then joins—another ancient Neolithic path:  
[29:44] the Icknield Way. Another of Britain’s oldest  roads, it’s one of the four highways of medieval  
[29:50] England, along with Ermine Street, the  Fosse Way, and Watling Street. And under  
[29:56] the laws of Edward the Confessor, travellers  on these roads were afforded royal protection.
[30:03] 19 kilometres to go. The final checkpoint is  not far away, but I have started wandering  
[30:17] all over the path and not being able to  keep my eyes open. 21 hours and 2 minutes.
[30:31] So I don’t think we’re going to make it under 24  
[30:35] hours. We’ve got three hours to  do 19K. Now, on any normal day,  
[30:42] that’s perfectly reasonable. You could do  that. But it’s not going to be done today.
[30:49] It has also been absolutely freezing  cold this morning since the sun’s come  
[30:55] up. Just at this moment now,  it’s starting to feel warm.
[31:32] “Film My Run.”
[31:33] “That’s right—Film My Run.  Absolutely. That’s brilliant.”
[31:37] According to my watch, we’ve got about  15 kilometres to go. I think this is aid  
[31:43] station checkpoint number eight. It’s  the final checkpoint on our way home.
[31:48] I’m going to walk out now with a  piece of bread, and that is me done.
[31:55] “Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.”
[31:59] There we go. OK, that’s the last aid station  done. I’m just going to meet Victoria in,  
[32:06] I think, about 6K, and then that’ll  leave us nine kilometres left to do.
[32:16] So you know I said I was weaving all over the  road a little while back? So tired. I decided  
[32:23] to have a little lie down at the aid station  there. And the thing that knocked me out of my  
[32:31] slumbers was when one of the volunteers said, “Oh,  there can’t be that many left to come in now.”
[32:40] That got me up.
[32:44] “Yeah, I think there’s only  about 12 or 13 people behind me.”
[33:07] “Good morning!”
[33:13] “Right, what’s your name?”
[33:14] “Tom Collier.”
[33:16] So I’m running this way with about  12K to go. Tom’s running this way,  
[33:21] and Tom says, “Hang on a minute,  you’re Film My Run, aren’t you?”
[33:26] “So what are you out doing today?”
[33:28] “27K training run.”
[33:30] “OK.”
[33:30] “Serpent Trail 50K in July. So sort of  wrapping up over the next couple of weeks,  
[33:33] doing long runs—build up to about 38K  
[33:38] and then taper back down ready for the  race. But yeah, first ultra, so excited.”
[33:43] “Well, good luck.”
[33:44] “Thank you very much, mate. Good luck to you.”
[33:54] It’s 5 to 9 on a Sunday morning.
[34:01] “Hello, Mr C. Ten and a half K to  go. You’ve got an iced coffee.”
[34:11] “Thank you.”
[34:13] “How are you feeling?”
[34:14] “My feet are in bits. Unfortunately, those socks  were a good idea, but maybe only for a marathon  
[34:23] or so. I think they’re… they’re really hurting my  feet. But other than that, I don’t feel too bad.  
[34:38] From somewhere I’ve found my legs and managed to  run relatively well over the final 10 kilometres.”
[34:44] Victoria had told me there were  quite a few runners up ahead of  
[34:47] me that perhaps I could pass if I  just put in a little more effort.
[34:52] Less than 5K to go now. 23 hours,  
[34:59] 46 minutes. So we’re probably going to get  in at around about 24 and a half hours.
[35:06] I felt pretty good these last couple of  hours. Managed to catch a few people.  
[35:13] Sun’s out, but there’s a nice breeze now.  It’s not a cold breeze like it was earlier.
[35:33] Less than a mile to go now. 1.3K. I’m just trying  
[35:40] to catch as many people as I  can in the last mile or so.
[35:50] There’s Avebury Stone Circle—and we are just  coming into the finish. 400 metres to go.  
[36:10] That was a hard effort. Put in  the work the last 10K as well.
[36:31] "The whole Ridgeway. Congrats!”
[36:33] “I’m pleased. Pleased I've done the  whole Ridgeway—but that was hard work.  
[36:38] That is a nice big medal."
[36:40] “A nice big medal for you.  You’ve earned that. Well done.”
[36:43] Lovely. Thank you very much.
[36:46] I didn’t really think I had a chance, but  that one last push in the final 10K took  
[36:52] me past one more V55 runner—and  I did it. I got third place in my  
[37:02] age group for the Ridgeway Challenge in  the British Trail Running Championships.
[37:08] I’ve spent the last 15 minutes just  lying down beyond the finish line there,  
[37:13] just trying to recover. That was really, really  hard work. The Ridgeway is absolutely gorgeous,  
[37:19] and beautiful sunshine yesterday and this morning.
[37:26] I just couldn’t function. I didn’t have any  speed in my legs, and I felt tired all the  
[37:31] time. And it’s probably—I mean, I haven’t  done enough training for this run. I’ve  
[37:37] kind of... today—or this run—is the start  of my training for the Swiss Alps 100. So  
[37:46] I didn’t really train for this, and it showed. I  was really wrecked for the majority of that run.
[37:55] You can only blame the heat a little  bit. It wasn’t that hot really.  
[38:00] I know—I use that excuse all the time, don’t I?
[38:03] But I’m so glad I did it. I’ve always  wanted to do the whole of the Ridgeway  
[38:06] and it’s now done. 139–140K on my  watch. Just really, really happy.
[38:16] Now I’m going to go get a coffee.
[38:19] Thank you so much for watching. Your support is  always appreciated. If you’re not subscribed to
