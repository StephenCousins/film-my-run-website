[00:02] ten past days on a Sunday morning in
[00:06] April in Paris are we gonna do
[00:15] [Music]
[00:31] absolutely trashed we're supposed to be
[00:35] pacing our lives thing about Paris's
[00:46] it's so packed there are many people
[00:49] that roamed Paris the London so you
[00:52] really have to make sure that you gain
[00:54] uqz a pen
[00:58] [Music]
[01:02] after we've all gone there's a massive
[01:04] clear up operation and you can see all
[01:07] the detritus on the floor that people
[01:08] just drop bottles jumpers coke
[01:16] do we go often to different sides of the
[01:19] street so the left-hand side of the
[01:21] street with the left and the right-hand
[01:23] side of the street with God regarding
[01:25] waves
[01:29] [Applause]
[01:30] [Music]
[01:45] [Music]
[01:52] while people miss the sights on the past
[01:54] nothing because they're so concentrated
[01:56] on
[02:05] [Music]
[02:12] - let me see
[02:17] so here we are at the steel atabaque 5k
[02:21] I suppose multi station here as well so
[02:25] it gets very crowded
[02:29] samurai Columbus's in 46 minutes
[02:36] okay we're just coming to buy the
[02:39] machines by 10k and I seen the 57
[02:42] minutes around
[02:44] churches passing the beautiful chateau
[02:47] de vincennes lugar were about seven
[02:50] miles now
[02:53] [Music]
[03:01] 13 half kilometres a one-hour 17 Eve's
[03:06] still running through the pocket of in
[03:07] Chinese
[03:10] then send mr. Venson apply Thurman
[03:14] Center
[03:24] [Music]
[03:33] halfway in the past mouthing we are
[03:36] falling behind now two hours in a minute
[03:38] Victoria start to get their crab she's
[03:40] spinning it in the heat so we just gonna
[03:42] chill out and see how we do
[03:48] so here at about 14 to 15 miles we drop
[03:50] down to run by the same
[03:52] [Music]
[03:58] 100 plus math then you'll get
[04:00] photographers taking a picture like this
[04:03] can't quite see how there is not to down
[04:07] to feed hey guys there's not to download
[04:11] [Music]
[04:15] big mansion
[04:17] sixteen
[04:19] nice master
[04:21] Jules you make
[04:29] so we're at $16 sixteen half miles
[04:33] Victoria's absolutely shuttered in them
[04:34] in the he it really is hot so we're
[04:37] taking it walking break for a bit just
[04:39] passing another water station what
[04:41] you'll notice about Paris is that they
[04:43] are very good they've got these bins all
[04:47] along the route at the beginning
[05:05] [Music]
[05:13] so many people have focused on their
[05:15] race in the parks back then they
[05:16] completely miss the Eiffel Tower and
[05:18] there are big signs here big water
[05:24] station here right opposite the tower so
[05:34] we just coming up to 30 kilometers in
[05:37] exactly three hours so about 12 minutes
[05:41] behind schedule
[05:43] the matter have
[05:47] [Music]
[05:58] just plus 20 miles in three hours 15
[06:01] minutes
[06:03] Vittorio's really struggling gussa doing
[06:06] the best you can in this heat
[06:09] I've been throwing loads of water over
[06:11] myself so we've got just under 10 K to
[06:14] go now
[06:24] just past 35 kilometers in 336
[06:31] [Music]
[06:42] [Music]
[06:52] this only appeared on the Paris mountain
[06:54] circuit a year ago
[07:00] [Music]
[07:22] [Music]
[07:44] [Music]
[07:53] [Music]
[07:59] [Music]
[08:06] another thing that's really good about
[08:08] pass - compared to maybe London is that
[08:11] you get an a station at the end of the
[08:13] race so all this food at the end of the
[08:16] race you wouldn't get that in London I
[08:18] do about Berlin on New York another
[08:21] reason I always think that Paris needs
[08:23] to be a major cuz it's so much better
[08:26] than so many of the markers see it just
[08:29] shows it's a big leap from a 146 half
[08:33] marathon to a 90 minute PB is not to be
[08:39] sniffed out come on then don't tell me
[08:43] tell me tell me yes so you wait for 30
[08:51] than you
[08:56] brilliant that's all we've got for you
[09:02] from the Paris mouth in 2018 Victoria
[09:05] gets a PB time near gets a PBY default
[09:08] cuz it's a first marriage than ever
[09:10] Antonio
[09:12] never again and I see so join us for
[09:15] another night in another time take care
[09:17] [Music]
[09:34] [Applause]
