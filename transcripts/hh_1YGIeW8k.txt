==================================================

[00:00] If you could choose to avoid one  specific type of weather when running,  
[00:04] what would it be? Me. It would be  the wind. If there's one thing that's  
[00:09] guaranteed to slow you down and SAP  your energy on a run, it's a headwind.
[00:14] So imagine my joy when I realised I would be  running my first UK Ultra event during Storm  
[00:21] Darragh, the fiercest storm to hit the  UK since Storm Eunice in 2022. The race  
[00:30] in fact came very close to being  cancelled. But with some trepidation,  
[00:35] at 7:20am, I made my way to the start line.
[00:40] Good morning. Welcome to a blustery  East Dean village in East Sussex.  
[00:46] Now we're here for the UK Ultra Winter 55 Miler.
[00:52] It's supposed to start in Eastbourne,  but the marquee company refused to set  
[00:56] up the marquees because it's too windy.  So we've had to move to the village hall  
[01:01] in east. This new start location, which  means the race is no longer 55 miles.
[01:07] It's about 50 miles. It's going to be blowy,  
[01:11] but hopefully not too wet. And this  is the start location here, look.
[01:19] So we're going to have a lovely blowy day. It's  
[01:21] going to take us all day from dark  till dark. Let's enjoy ourselves.
[01:33] I don't know why I'm so far forward. Okay,  away we go on the winter downs. 55 or 50  
[02:00] and we're running uphill to  start that enthusiastic run.
[02:06] Very soon turn to a walk as we made our  way up the hill and out onto Crow Link  
[02:12] Lane. The route took us down to join  the Seven Sisters Cliffs just west of  
[02:18] Beachy Head and Burling Gap. We were  already being buffeted by the wind.
[02:23] But the moment we reached the sea and turned onto  the Sisters, the storm reached another level.  
[02:41] It was all we could do to stay on  our feet most of the time during  
[02:45] those first few miles. Thankfully,  it wasn't too long before we turned  
[02:50] inland at the Cuckmere river and the  wind didn't feel quite so strong.
[02:55] All I could think was at least  it wasn't raining and I was  
[02:59] comfortable in my three layers. I was wearing  a base layer, my montane fleece and montane  
[03:07] phase nano jacket. On my feet were my Hoka  Speedgoat 6 with mid weight Injinji socks.
[03:15] Just over 5K in, well, 51 a half K in  41 minutes. We've just come over about  
[03:23] three or four of the seven sisters from East  Dean where we started and just dropped down  
[03:30] into the Cuckmere Valley and we'll be  hitting Exceat or Exceat shortly and  
[03:38] then it's on through Friston Forest.  Very windy, this little section.
[03:45] We've got the wind behind  us climbing up this hill,  
[03:47] but coming along, it's been  right in our faces all the time.  
[04:27] What's your name? Pete. Pete, this is.
[04:30] This is your first, is it? Yeah, first  50 miler. How you feeling so far? Yeah,  
[04:34] not bad, not bad. Trying to stay upright.
[04:38] Yeah. Not set off too quick. So we  are 9k in and we're just coming up  
[04:46] to the first checkpoint because  the route has been shortened.
[04:51] This first checkpoint has come about  five miles earlier than it would have  
[04:54] done. But we're just approaching the village of  Litlington and if you've been paying attention,  
[05:02] we've kind of been following the Beachy  Head Marathon route in reverse for much  
[05:07] of this first part of the course. It's very  slippy here, so I'm just going to be care.
[05:17] Are we all right to just go?  Lovely, thank you. Right,  
[05:21] there's the first checkpoint there,  but I'm gonna carry on because my  
[05:25] wife is gonna meet me shortly in about  6k, so we'll just carry on. Thank you.
[05:31] See ya. Cheers, Budd. Climbing out of Litlington,  
[05:49] the sun made an appearance and the  Cuckmere Valley looked stunning.
[05:54] For the briefest of moments, it looked  like the worst might be behind us. The  
[05:59] wind wasn't quite as bad as we ran away from  the coast, past the Litlington White Horse  
[06:06] and onto a muddy but more sheltered  path. This respite didn't last long,  
[06:12] though, as soon we turned to head down to  Bishopstone and my first crew rendezvous.
[06:18] Exposed in an open field, we were battling a  headwind once again. Right, we are 10 miles in,  
[06:25] we're at Bishopstone. Family have come  to meet me because they're crewing.
[06:27] This is a cup of tea. He doesn't want  the sausage sandwich. I've made him.
[06:38] Let me take that. Write him off. See you later.
[06:40] Just don't. No. Don't you  want the tea? Well, all right.
[06:43] Quickly then. Then you can drink  it down. Is it really bad when  
[06:51] you're exposed? It's really, really strong.
[06:53] So I'm not going to see you now till 1:30 in the  
[06:55] afternoon? Around about. Might be a bit  later than that. All right, take care.
[07:01] Right, there we go. So, yeah,  Bishopstone, 10 miles in. Feeling fine.
[07:07] So I've got my wife's food meal in a drink. Also  got my Protein Rebel maple ignite gel. Very tasty.
[07:16] Thank you to them for sending me  these. And just under 2 hours,  
[07:21] 1:59:30 as we just leave Bishopstone. Overall,  I have to say I was really enjoying myself.
[07:30] We were running on some trails I know very well,  but also on some I'd never run on before, which,  
[07:36] along with the weather, was making for a very  entertaining adventure. And it was about to  
[07:42] get more entertaining because as we climbed up  towards Firle Beacon and the South Downs way,  
[07:48] it started to rain. I don't know about you,  but rain is supposed to fall down from above,  
[07:54] but this rain seemed to be  coming from the side very fast.
[08:01] We've done a half marathon  in 2 hours 42. This is the  
[08:06] worst of the weather so far. It's now  raining and really exposed and blowy.
[08:13] Really strong winds. We're up on  Firle Beacon, so that tower there  
[08:18] is Firle Beacon and we'll be coming back  just a bit beyond there on our way back,  
[08:24] but now we're heading down into South  Ease. You can hear how windy it is.
[08:30] It's absolutely crazy. I'll actually turn  on the GoPro mic now so you can hear just  
[08:36] how windy it really is. Seaford and  Newhaven in the background there.
[09:03] We dropped down to the farm and the youth  hostel at south ease, crossing three bridges,  
[09:09] one over the A26 road, one over the railway  and one over the River Ouse. It was lovely  
[09:15] to see Carla from Time on Feet doing her bit  for the community in the pouring rain. There  
[09:21] was an aid station at South Ease, but I  didn't need anything, so I carried on.
[09:33] 2 hours, 23 minutes, 27 kilometres. Done. We are  
[09:41] in a wind tunnel here because there's  a hill on either side of this path.
[09:47] We're on the South Downs way and we're  heading up now and then down to Houston  
[09:54] Farm and then we'll be going to Lewis. It  is absolutely blowing a hoolie as I am sure
[10:04] I'm sure you can probably hear it. Remarkably,  
[10:12] I'm kind of having type two fun, definitely.  Now, firmly on the South Downs way,  
[10:20] we climbed up to what is commonly  referred to as the Yellow Brick Road.
[10:24] And this is where Storm Darragh gave us everything  it had. We were often blown backwards with  
[10:30] the gusts. If I exposed my hands, the wind  chill factor made them absolutely freezing.
[10:37] I didn't want to stop to get my gloves  out, but pulling my sleeves down provided  
[10:42] just enough protection. Progress was  achingly slow and it was an absolute  
[10:47] relief to get to the top and make our  way round to Castle Hill and eventually  
[10:52] down to Housedean Farm and the next aid  station. Who would have imagined that  
[11:00] on The South Downs way, we'd experience some  of the worst weather I've ever had in a run.
[11:08] Gale force winds, driving rain, freezing  cold. But hopefully the worst is behind  
[11:15] us now. We are 36k in, just coming  into Housedean Farm aid station.
[11:23] So I'm gonna get a bite to eat there.  How you doing, boys? Yeah, loving life.  
[11:29] He says that on the top of the hill in top of  the ridge, he went, I'm not sure I can do this.
[11:35] You know, I looked him dead  in the eye and was like,  
[11:37] I can't continue. But I'm here and  we're getting it done. Yeah, okay.
[11:47] Oh, my. Glad to see this aid station.  Have you got any Marmite? Yes, perfect.
[11:53] Hello. You all right? Yeah, good.  How you doing? I'm glad that Rich.
[11:58] That was horrendous. Some of the worst running  conditions I've ever been. Yeah, really? Scotland,  
[12:05] honestly, some of the wind up there  was worse to the top of Ben Nevis.
[12:08] Wow. I agree with that. Yeah.
[12:11] Can't beat Marmite sandwiches. I've got coffee,  
[12:16] I've got some Mars bars and  Marmite sandwiches. That's it.
[12:23] And then at the aid station and we're on  our way to Lewis now. So I've got to climb.  
[12:29] Climb a big hill still on the South Downs Way.
[12:33] But then when we get to the top of that hill,  
[12:35] instead of turning left and continuing on  the South Downs way, we turn right and go  
[12:40] down into Lewes. And that's where  I'm going to meet Victoria next.  
[13:10] So this is where we leave the South Downs Way.
[13:14] Instead of turning left, we go this way. We're  about five and a half hours in to the UK Ultra  
[13:30] Winter 55, which is now the Winter 50,  and we've done 41km. So not far off a  
[13:39] marathon now, but similar to my Beachy Head  marathon, which was five hours 25 minutes.
[13:49] Yeah, we're not. Not as fast as I want to  be, really, but we just have to accept that,  
[13:56] unfortunately. So I was hoping to do 10 miles  every two hours, but I've fallen behind that now.
[14:05] The wind is not quite as bad now. It was quite  bad coming up the ridge out of Housedean Farm,  
[14:11] but nowhere near as bad as on top of the ridge  before Housedean Farm. We're still blowy,  
[14:19] but now we should have the wind  behind us most of the way home.
[14:24] We're over halfway, so let's  see how we got on in the second  
[14:29] half. Once again, I found myself running on  trails I'd never run on before. Up on Black  
[14:36] Cap and down into the village of Offham,  where there was another aid station.
[14:41] Again, I didn't need anything as I  knew I'd be seeing my wife in Lewis,  
[14:45] but I did stop briefly to use the facilities. I  was generally feeling fine, no gastric discomfort,  
[14:52] no sickness or nausea, but something  was obviously playing up because I had  
[14:57] to sit on the loo twice during the race,  which is not normal for me. After Offham,  
[15:03] we continued to drop down until we hit the  banks of the River Ouse again and made our  
[15:08] way into Lewes via Mauling Wreck, where I met  Victoria, who had hot soup and tea for me.
[15:22] 6 hours 39 minutes, 49K. I've just  seen Victoria down in Lewes. We're  
[15:32] now climbing up out of Lewes,  Lewis, the county town of Sussex.
[15:38] The next time I see Victoria is at Bo Peep Car  park, which is back on the South Downs Way.  
[15:45] That's in 12 kilometres. I think we've got an aid  station before that because I was seeing Victoria.
[15:51] I missed out the last aid station at  Offham, which was just before Lewis.  
[16:00] I seem to be doing quite well at aid stations  because I'm in and out quite quickly and I seem  
[16:06] to overtake a lot of people who are sitting in  the aid station, but then they all overtake me  
[16:13] when we're on the trails again. My back and  my hips are aching, so I've just had some  
[16:22] paracetamol when I saw Victoria as well, so  hopefully that'll make me feel a bit better.
[16:30] I've had some super. Some tea and some  chocolate, so that should see me right  
[16:36] to the next aid station. Other than  the hips aching, feel okay actually.
[16:42] Stomach's good. So nearly 50k in by now for  the most part. We had the wind behind us.
[17:03] It was still gusting really strong at times,  making it fun to momentarily fly through  
[17:09] the air. The worst of the storm was definitely  behind us now. As I was making my way to Glynde,  
[17:15] I came across one of the back  markers in the 100 mile race.
[17:19] What was the night like? Was really bad. Yeah.  Like the wind could move you at its worst, like.
[17:26] It was. Yeah, it's. I mean, it was bad  enough during the day on those ridges.
[17:30] I was at the top. It was. Yeah.
[17:31] Disgusting. And then the sideways rain and stuff,  you know, 53 and a half kilometres in seven hours,  
[17:56] 20 minutes. I've just been  to the Glynde aid station.
[18:01] So we've just come through the village of Glynde  after a lovely drop down off a lovely grassy hill,  
[18:11] which is very nice. And now we're  stuck in this absolutely claggy,  
[18:15] muddy field. Look at my, look at my shoes.
[18:23] That's ridiculous. Just got a Marmite  sandwich. I'm seeing Victoria in about 6K, 7K.
[18:35] The route took us out of Glynde  and onto West Firle where I made  
[18:39] an annoying navigation error. A van pulled  out and obscured a sign pointing left. So I  
[18:46] ran 300 meters further on the road  and had to come all the way back.
[18:52] But a 600 metre diversion is nothing  to one story. I heard of two guys who  
[18:57] ran an extra 4 miles before they  received a phone call from HQ.  
[19:28] 7 hours 48 minutes into the winter 55  by UK Ultras the weather is perfect now.
[19:39] I mean it's a bit windy but it's absolutely fine.  
[19:42] Temperature is really good.  Just passing through Firle.
[19:46] So we're on the road and we're about to climb  up to near Firle Beacon, which we were at this  
[19:55] morning on our way out. Lots of vans here.  I assume some of these are crewing vans.
[20:02] Four people in the race. But yeah,  we're on this road heading out,  
[20:11] heading out of Firle on the way up to Firle  Beacon. Then we're going to turn left on the  
[20:16] ridge and I'll meet my wife at the next  car park on the top of the ridge called  
[20:22] Bo Peep. Definitely not going to make  it in 10 hours now, but there we are.
[20:29] Definitely slowed down a bit. Just legs aren't  
[20:34] moving as quick as I want them  to. Just over 13 miles to go.
[20:38] How's it going boys? Good, thank  you. Yeah. Tell me who you are.
[20:41] I'm in. I'm Andrew. We're brothers.
[20:46] Nice. We've done a few of these together.  Nothing as windy or as wild as this.
[20:51] Nothing like this. What's the most extreme  thing you've done? The furthest distance  
[20:56] or the toughest race? I've done 100k but  different ones. Benign summer conditions.
[21:01] This is extreme Serpent. You've done the  Serpent, I've done the Wayfarers. Lovely.
[21:05] But yeah, this is something else. Yeah,  yeah. We're gonna get it done though,  
[21:09] aren't we? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get done.
[21:12] The end is in sight. So this is  Bo Peep car park. I've got soup.
[21:30] It's perfect. Now the wind is behind us so  it's pushing us along. It's really good.
[21:40] I won't drink. I don't want  all of this. No, no, I don't.
[21:43] I'm fine. I don't want all of  it. 61km in 8 hours 34 minutes.
[22:06] Big fan of Your work. Oh, thank you  very much. It's very kind of you.
[22:09] What's your name? Gareth.  Gareth Alfriston. Here for you.
[22:13] Alfriston, Gareth. It's.  What time is it now? So 4:30.
[22:21] We've got about 15k to go. I'm leaving  Alfriston now. Take care, guys.
[22:26] Thanks, guys. Bye. Thank you.
[22:30] Cheers. Thank you very much. Right, away we go.
[22:41] Now, this is pretty pointless, but it's very nice  of UK Ultras to bring us down off the South Downs  
[22:49] way to let us see the Long Man of Wilmington.  And right behind me on the hillside is the famous  
[22:57] chalk man on the side of the hill, the Long Man  of Wilmington just behind me there. Oh, dear.
[23:09] Okay, never mind. And now we've got to go  all the way back up the hill to join the  
[23:15] South Downs Way again. It would have been nice  to see it in the daylight, but there we are.
[23:21] Yeah. Right. While I've got a  bit of light, we're in Jevington.
[23:24] We've got about 8, 7 or 8k to go. And we're not  following the South Downs Way now. We've come  
[23:32] up and we're going a different way up to Butts  Brow, where I'll see my wife for the final time.
[23:36] So let's get this last bit  done. Okay. Yeah, I see it.
[23:44] Okay, thank you, guys. And with that, I was on  my way again. No longer following the South Downs  
[23:52] Way, a long, gradual incline took us back up to  the ridge overlooking the lights of Eastbourne.
[23:59] I knew I wasn't far away from the  finish. One more brief stop with  
[24:04] Victoria at Butts Brow car Park, where I  had a quick coffee. And my crew tried to  
[24:09] persuade me to put some gloves on as they  were getting worried about me being cold.
[24:15] I tried to reassure them that I wasn't  hypothermic. And I felt. Felt absolutely fine.
[24:21] The wind was cold, and I can totally  understand why they thought I might  
[24:25] be freezing, but I really wasn't.  Four more miles of flat and downhill  
[24:30] separated me from the finish line. I  ran past Willingdon Golf Club and then  
[24:35] Eastbourne Downs Golf Club before a right  turn and a long descent into East Dean.
[24:41] The finish line was the door  of the village hall. At least  
[24:44] I think it was. So we're coming  to the end right into the finish.
[25:02] Thank you, guys. Cheers, buddy. Sorry.
[25:10] Fix. We are done. Yeah,  I've done it loads of times.
[25:18] Yeah. YouTube aah yes.
[25:19] Yes. Hello. I've watched your video.
[25:21] Hello. And the reason why I did it. Oh, no, don't.
[25:26] I tell you what, that was an adventure.  
[25:34] Hello. How Dare you finish ahead  of me in the 100 mile? Absolutely.
[25:40] Go on, then, stick it over there.  Thank you very much, mate. Cheers.
[25:44] Neil Kirby is the race director of  today's monumental, ridiculous race.  
[25:51] How do you feel it's gone, Neil, because  it was. It was tough conditions out there.
[25:59] Do you think the team managed it? Well, I mean,  
[26:01] I, you know, I. Yeah, yeah,  definitely. I mean, it was.
[26:04] It was very touch and go. So whether  it was going to go ahead or not. Yeah.
[26:08] How close were you to saying it  was? Just so many people got in  
[26:14] touch and wanted to do it and they  were really up for doing it. So,  
[26:20] yeah, I just made the decision. I  didn't want to let people down, so.
[26:23] Yeah, yeah. Well, I loved it. I loved it.
[26:27] It was great. Thank you. Cheers.
[26:28] Now the UK Ultra Winter on the Downs  55 was everything an Ultra should be.  
[26:34] It was an exhilarating and at times potentially  perilous adventure on a lovely course with lots  
[26:41] of support throughout. All great Ultra races  combine a scenic route, challenging weather  
[26:47] and that slight element of danger, be it the  terrain or in this case, the extreme wind.
[26:53] That's what raises the satisfaction and  enjoyment level of these events above the  
[26:58] others. Thanks to all the marshals and  volunteers for giving up their time in  
[27:03] such difficult conditions. And well done to  Neil and the team for their organisation.
[27:08] Thanks so much for watching and if you've  enjoyed the video and appreciate the effort,  
[27:12] do please drop a like. And if you're not  subscribed to the channel, go and do that  
[27:16] now. Click on the screen now to watch what was  without question the toughest race I've ever run.
[27:23] And I will see you guys on  the start line next time.
