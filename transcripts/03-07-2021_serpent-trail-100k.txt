i'm still so wrecked but when it's like this you know you can't complain it's so beautiful here [Music] it's about 10 to 5 in the morning i'm just having rice pudding for my breakfast i've just been bought some coffee and we're here to do the surfer trail 100k oh for god's sake all three of us talking about [Music] welcome to film my run it's very early in the morning on a saturday in july and we're here in hazelmere to run the serpent trail 100k i did it about four years ago there were a lot fewer people four years ago there's loads of us now so you know chances of a top 10 finish are gone gone but there we are never mind we'll see what we do [Music] [Music] we're about seven and a half miles into the serpent trail 100k uh we've been running for an hour and a quarter climbed 400 meters of ascent so we're doing all right at the moment it's cool it's overcast so it should be perfect running conditions really [Music] [Music] right two hours and 13 minutes into the serpent trail 100k we've climbed just over 700 meters of a cent so far which is not not quite half yet of what we're going to do and we've done approaching 21k so about 13 miles done beautiful forest that we're going through yeah this way we're following little uh purple triangle signs that indicate the way and i keep missing them i've gone the wrong way a couple of times already so i'm a bit uh i'm not so confident on exactly where the route is although i do have it on my watch so shouldn't go too far wrong really [Music] i'm always [Music] so 20 miles is 32 kilometers and uh we've done that in three and a half hours just over three and a half hours now considering that i was thinking maybe 12 hours might be a good time for me to do today if i continued at this pace by finishing ten and a half hours and i think that's too fast for me so i am probably gonna slow down a bit so many times i'm always [Music] we've done a marathon and we took that in four hours 50 minutes 4 hours 50 minutes for a marathon trail marathon that's not too bad is it and um we're not too far off halfway it's been pouring with rains but that's been good because it's uh it's helped the heat dissipate a little bit so it's not so hard to run but of course it is now muddier underfoot [Music] so that's actually 51 kilometers now done on my watch [Music] five hours 50 minutes we're just coming into petworth now where the midway aid station is so it may be that i have to do a few more than 100k to finish this race [Music] infatuated [Music] seven hours and 12 minutes in 60 kilometers done which is around about i get 38 miles something like that very tired and now a few people have started to pass me as well it's a bit worrying i'm still running but i'm just not running as fast as i was certainly not running up the hills anymore so that little experiment has failed uh but you know it is what it is we'll get to the end um so we're looking at anything 12 to 13 hours hopefully now i don't think at the speed i'm going i'm gonna make it in 12 hours [Music] [Music] right we're 70 kilometers in in eight hours 45 minutes but that's me done i am absolutely shattered now most of the elevations done it's pretty um it's pretty flat from here on in but i've just got no energy in my legs my back's aching and i'd like it to be over we've got still got 20 miles to go because it's about 102 kilometers so still 20 miles [Music] so we're 10 hours and 21 minutes in to the serpent trail 100k and i've just hit 80 kilometers so that's just under 50 miles and we've got about 22 kilometers left to go just over 13 miles left to run absolutely done in i think it's to do with um the southbound way 100 recently i think my legs just aren't recovered enough because my stomach's fine it's not it really isn't too hot it's warm but it's not overly hot so i don't think it's that [Music] right because despite being completely knackered we still have time to say thank you to all the volunteers so i've been on the coke today mostly um and marmite sandwiches have been my thing as well today [Music] well the sun is out we're in beautiful countryside and we only have 10 well actually 12k to go we've just hit 90 kilometers i'm still so wrecked but when it's like this you know you can't complain it's so beautiful here [Music] i'm all right now i'll just get to the end now thank you very much for being there though you're welcome cheers guys thank you the watch has just here 100k 13 hours and 19 minutes for that 100k but we still have two and a half k to go just uh jogging it along basically it's about nine minute kilometers and uh yeah it's still hurting but i know that we're there now i know we've got it done and i know we've got it in under 14 hours so i'm i'm relatively pleased with that given the collapse at 50k [Music] just going up to the finish now 100 meters to go we're going to do it in us uh we're gonna do it in 13 hours 42 ish 103 kilometers pretty much but here we go it's been so nice hearing people beeping their car horns as well coming through petersfield and here we go [Music] [Music] oh god my time won't be valid [Music] that was so hard [Music] [Applause] [Music] right i've had a shower i feel a lot better than when i finished let me tell you it's a great atmosphere here we've got the england european championship game between england and ukraine going on uh up there in the rugby club and it's it's currently four nil to england we've got runners finishing here and there's bells clanging and people cheering and all sorts of stuff really lovely atmosphere there's food being cooked over here and food and drinks if you want a coffee you can go there or burgers or salad or whatever you want is over there people are sitting down just enjoying the evening and it's been it's been really great the run was really hard really hard i'm so tired i'm so tired from it but um it's a great course if you do get the chance to come and do the serpent trail either the 50k or the 100k if you're interested in the 50k my friend lloyd from run for adventure he's got a video of the 50k today on his channel so go and watch that until the next time we do a crazy ultra

[00:01] i'm still so wrecked but
[00:04] when it's like this you know you can't
[00:06] complain it's so beautiful here
[00:11] [Music]
[00:16] it's about 10 to 5 in the morning i'm
[00:18] just having rice pudding for my
[00:19] breakfast i've just been bought some
[00:21] coffee
[00:22] and we're here to do the surfer trail
[00:24] 100k
[00:26] oh for god's sake all three of us
[00:29] talking about
[00:31] [Music]
[01:09] welcome to film my run it's very early
[01:11] in the morning on a saturday
[01:13] in july and we're here in hazelmere
[01:16] to run the serpent trail 100k i did it
[01:20] about four years ago there were a lot
[01:21] fewer people four years ago there's
[01:24] loads of us now so you know chances of a
[01:27] top 10 finish are gone gone but there we
[01:29] are never mind we'll see what we do
[01:35] [Music]
[01:43] [Music]
[02:21] we're about seven and a half miles into
[02:23] the serpent trail 100k
[02:26] uh we've been running for an hour and a
[02:27] quarter climbed 400 meters of ascent
[02:32] so we're doing all right at the moment
[02:34] it's cool
[02:35] it's overcast
[02:37] so it should be perfect running
[02:38] conditions really
[02:40] [Music]
[02:58] [Music]
[03:06] right two hours and 13 minutes into the
[03:09] serpent trail
[03:11] 100k
[03:12] we've climbed just over 700 meters of a
[03:15] cent so far
[03:17] which is
[03:18] not not quite half yet of what we're
[03:21] going to do
[03:22] and we've done
[03:24] approaching 21k so about 13 miles
[03:28] done
[03:29] beautiful forest that we're going
[03:30] through
[03:35] yeah this way
[03:37] we're following little uh
[03:40] purple triangle signs that indicate the
[03:42] way and i keep missing them i've gone
[03:44] the wrong way a couple of times already
[03:47] so i'm a bit uh
[03:49] i'm not so confident on exactly where
[03:51] the route is although i do have it on my
[03:52] watch
[03:53] so shouldn't go too far wrong really
[03:57] [Music]
[04:12] i'm always
[04:13] [Music]
[04:25] so 20 miles is 32 kilometers
[04:28] and uh we've done that in three and a
[04:30] half hours just over three and a half
[04:32] hours now
[04:33] considering that
[04:34] i was thinking maybe 12 hours might be a
[04:37] good time
[04:38] for me to do today
[04:40] if i continued at this pace
[04:42] by finishing ten and a half hours and i
[04:44] think that's too fast for me so
[04:46] i am probably gonna slow down a bit
[04:50] so many times
[05:05] i'm always
[05:07] [Music]
[05:12] we've done a marathon
[05:13] and we took that in four hours
[05:16] 50 minutes 4 hours 50 minutes for a
[05:18] marathon
[05:20] trail marathon that's not too bad is it
[05:23] and um we're not too far off halfway
[05:27] it's been pouring with rains
[05:29] but that's been good because it's uh
[05:32] it's helped the heat
[05:33] dissipate a little bit so
[05:35] it's not so hard to run but of course it
[05:36] is now muddier underfoot
[05:40] [Music]
[05:44] so that's actually 51 kilometers now
[05:46] done on my watch
[05:48] [Music]
[05:49] five hours 50 minutes we're just coming
[05:52] into petworth now
[05:54] where the
[05:56] midway aid station is
[05:58] so it may be that i have to do a few
[06:00] more than 100k
[06:02] to finish this race
[06:09] [Music]
[06:10] infatuated
[06:21] [Music]
[06:31] seven hours and 12 minutes in
[06:35] 60 kilometers done which is around about
[06:38] i get 38 miles something like that
[06:42] very tired
[06:44] and now a few people have started to
[06:47] pass me as well
[06:48] it's a bit worrying
[06:50] i'm still running but i'm just not
[06:52] running as fast as i was
[06:54] certainly not running up the hills
[06:56] anymore so that little experiment has
[06:58] failed
[07:01] uh
[07:02] but you know it is what it is we'll get
[07:04] to the end
[07:05] um
[07:08] so we're looking at anything 12 to 13
[07:10] hours hopefully now
[07:12] i don't think
[07:14] at the speed i'm going i'm gonna make it
[07:16] in 12 hours
[07:23] [Music]
[07:34] [Music]
[07:55] right we're 70 kilometers in in eight
[07:57] hours 45 minutes
[08:00] but that's me done i am absolutely
[08:02] shattered now
[08:03] most of the elevations done it's pretty
[08:05] um
[08:07] it's pretty flat from here on in
[08:09] but i've just got no energy in my legs
[08:11] my back's aching
[08:13] and
[08:15] i'd like it to be over we've got still
[08:16] got 20 miles to go because it's about
[08:18] 102 kilometers
[08:21] so
[08:22] still 20 miles
[08:25] [Music]
[08:48] so we're 10 hours and 21 minutes in
[08:52] to the serpent trail 100k
[08:54] and i've just hit 80 kilometers
[08:57] so that's just under 50 miles
[09:00] and we've got about 22 kilometers left
[09:03] to go
[09:04] just over 13 miles
[09:07] left to run
[09:08] absolutely done in
[09:11] i think it's to do with um the
[09:13] southbound way 100 recently i think
[09:16] my legs just aren't recovered
[09:18] enough because my stomach's fine
[09:21] it's not it really isn't too hot
[09:23] it's warm but it's not
[09:25] overly hot so i don't think it's that
[09:29] [Music]
[09:36] right because despite being completely
[09:38] knackered
[09:39] we still have time to say thank you to
[09:41] all the volunteers so i've been on the
[09:43] coke today mostly
[09:45] um and marmite sandwiches have been my
[09:48] thing as well today
[09:50] [Music]
[09:56] well the sun is out
[09:59] we're in beautiful countryside
[10:03] and we only have 10 well actually 12k to
[10:06] go we've just hit 90 kilometers
[10:09] i'm still so wrecked but
[10:12] when it's like this you know you can't
[10:14] complain it's so beautiful here

[10:30] end now thank you very much for being
[10:31] there though you're welcome cheers guys
[10:33] thank you
[10:38] the watch has just here 100k
[10:41] 13 hours and 19 minutes for that 100k
[10:44] but we still have
[10:46] two and a half k to go
[10:50] just uh jogging it along basically it's
[10:52] about
[10:53] nine minute kilometers
[10:57] and uh
[10:58] yeah it's still hurting but i know that
[11:00] we're there now i know we've got it done
[11:02] and i know we've got it in under 14
[11:04] hours so
[11:05] i'm i'm relatively pleased with that
[11:07] given
[11:08] the collapse at 50k
[11:13] [Music]

[11:43] their car horns as well
[11:45] coming through petersfield
