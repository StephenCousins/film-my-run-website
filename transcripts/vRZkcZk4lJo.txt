==================================================

[00:00] What an absolutely beautiful morning it is.  Having done Race to the Stones last year,  
[00:08] I was so impressed. I loved it so much. I am back  again for a second time. Over the years, Race to  
[00:17] the Stones has managed to carve out a reputation  as one of the ultra-distance events of the year,  
[00:23] attracting both beginners and seasoned runners.  The flat, easy terrain gives the elites a fast,  
[00:30] runnable course and those new to ultra distances  a less intimidating entry point to the sport.  
[00:38] It’s really well provisioned here. Medics are  there; you’ve got coffee and a breakfast bar  
[00:45] over there. Geo-trackers—trackers if you  need them—here, if you have a drop bag.  
[00:51] People are putting their drop bags in these vans  to be taken to base camp at halfway. That’s 50 km,  
[00:57] and also the end of the race, which is  in Avebury. At Avebury Stones. People are  
[01:03] collecting their numbers over there and then  writing all their details on their race bib  
[01:09] here. Just before the start, I was fortunate  enough to see Sophie Power and Hugh Tibbs,  
[01:16] both favourites to do well. Hello, Sophie—good  luck. This is Hugh—he’s going to win. Right,  
[01:27] the sunglasses are on, so it’s serious race  mode now. We are off in three minutes. Time  
[01:32] to run along one of the most ancient pathways  in the UK, the Ridgeway. It’s going to be an  
[01:39] absolutely beautiful day. We’re going  to have a superb time. Away we go.  
[02:02] What with the generous cut-offs and  incredibly well-stocked pit stops,  
[02:07] it was tempting to treat this as a lovely day out  in the countryside. But as I crossed the line,  
[02:13] I remembered there was also some running to do.  So we’ve run about 800 metres from the start at  
[02:21] Lewknor and now through the field and joining  the Ridgeway trail. We’re about 40 kilometres  
[02:31] into the Ridgeway trail at the start of this race.  Early on, the trails were smooth, dry and busy,  
[02:39] with runners chatting away enthusiastically  about the adventure that lay ahead. So that’s  
[02:46] five kilometres of Race to the Stones—20:25 in 31  minutes—ticking over relatively comfortably. It’s  
[02:57] very tempting on days like this to go out hard  early on when it’s cool and get some miles banked.  
[03:08] Let me tell you, banking miles is possibly the  worst thing you can do in a race of this length.  
[03:16] You just have to accept that you’re going  to need to go nice and easy and, hopefully,  
[03:24] you’ve got something left in the second half.  The first 5K has all been in the shade—nice,  
[03:31] covered trail. This is the first bit of exposure  we’ve had so far. Whilst Race to the Stones is  
[03:38] pretty flat, it’s not pan-flat, and there are some  cheeky inclines to get up here and there. But the  
[03:46] good thing about hills is that you can use them as  natural walking breaks. In a race of this length,  
[03:51] most of us are not running the entire distance,  and walking the hills provides a great natural  
[03:57] break. Isn’t this beautiful in here? With less  than 10 km on the watch, it was early days.  
[04:05] Time to relax, enjoy the scenery and the fresh  air, but also to stay disciplined with pacing,  
[04:11] eating and drinking. Talking of eating and  drinking, we were about to arrive at the first  
[04:17] pit stop. “Hello, thank you.” — “Welcome to Pit  Stop 1.” — “Thank you, bye, buddy.” On the rolling  
[04:28] Chiltern Hills. Nine kilometres in. This is St  Botolph’s in Swyncombe. We’ve just passed Pit Stop  
[04:36] 1. Everybody’s filled up their bottles and we’re  on our way again. This is a little bit rolling,  
[04:42] this section—some ups and some downs and  some beautiful cornfields. “Why are you here,  
[04:52] Chris?” — “I don’t know, it’s a good question  that. Chasing a bit of me, maybe? No, because  
[04:57] I’m mental.” — “How many of these kind of things  have you done before?” — “First one.” — “Oh,  
[05:02] wow.” — “Number one.” — “We know. Numero.” —  “Yeah. Good luck.” — “Yeah, thank you.” — “Picked  
[05:06] a great day for it.” — “Could say that.” Quick kit  check. I’m wearing a Flying Burrito shirt (link in  
[05:19] the description for that). I have a Salomon soft  flask in my UltraAspire race belt. I’m wearing  
[05:25] 2XU compression shorts with SAXX underwear.  On my feet I’ve gone with my trusty Hoka  
[05:32] Skyward X and Injinji toe socks. I’m also using  Enertor insoles and, along with Flying Burrito,  
[05:39] they are the sponsors of today’s video. I  absolutely love my Enertor, especially on  
[05:45] long runs like this. They give my joints so much  protection. 13 km in. This is St Lawrence Church  
[05:53] in Nuffield. An hour and a half—that’s not bad,  is it? We’ll take that. “How’s it going?” — “Good,  
[06:01] good.” — “Low heart rate, eh?” — “Yeah.” So,  a lot of crew meeting there. Runners here. Hi  
[06:12] there. You can hear my watch beeping there telling  me to turn. Navigation is quite straightforward on  
[06:20] Race to the Stones and it’s really well marked,  but I like to have the route loaded on my watch  
[06:26] just as an extra sanity check. This is one of the  most beautiful and ancient parts of the Ridgeway.  
[06:36] We’re on Grim’s Ditch. Grim’s Ditch runs parallel  to, and along the same route as, the Ridgeway for  
[06:43] some of it, and right now we’re on this raised  earthwork—ditches and raised earthwork—called  
[06:51] Grim’s Ditch, dating back to the Iron Age.  Just hit 20 km in 2 hours and 20 minutes.  
[07:12] We’ve got all the 50K runners from the later  wave start, all the fast 50K runners coming  
[07:19] past us at the moment, and it’s very tempting, if  you’re not careful, to get dragged along behind  
[07:24] them and start going at a pace which is far too  fast for what you should be doing when you’re  
[07:29] doing the 100K. Not far away from our second pit  stop, coming up at about 21 km—approaching a half  
[07:39] marathon. I was looking forward to a bite to eat.  Thankfully, Threshold’s pit stops are some of the  
[07:45] most well-stocked I’ve ever experienced. You’re  not going to go hungry on Race to the Stones,  
[07:51] with sandwiches, crisps, fruit, chocolate, sweets,  gels and plenty more. Okay, Checkpoint 2—Pit  
[07:59] Stop 2. Quick toilet break and fill up water;  maybe have a bite to eat as well. “Hi, guys.  
[08:09] Today I think it’s important to try and make sure  we eat a lot in the first half of the run. So  
[08:15] I’ve got milk and I’ve got a sandwich.” “What’s  your name?” — “Evie Musgrave.” — “Why are you  
[08:28] here running this when you’re from up north?” —  “Because I’m doing it for Cancer Research.” — “Oh,  
[08:32] good for you.” — “Yeah, so I’ve raised £1,600  for them.” — “And how many ultra distances have  
[08:38] you done before?” — “The furthest I’ve done  is a marathon.” — “Wow. So this is your first  
[08:42] ultra?” — “Yeah.” — “And you’ve gone for 100K?” —  “I have.” — “How do you feel about yourself?” — “A  
[08:47] bit delirious right now. I’m thinking, ‘What  if I don’t?’” — “No, it’ll all be worth it.  
[08:52] Good luck.” — “Thank you.” So that’s Checkpoint  2—Pit Stop 2—done. 21K done, and we’re on our  
[09:07] way again now with about 8 kilometres till I meet  Victoria, and 14 km to Pit Stop 3. This is one of  
[09:16] my favourite little bits of the Ridgeway. Look at  this little cabin. I’ve pointed this out before  
[09:22] many times on this Ridgeway path. A lovely little  cabin there, right by the water. Absolutely love  
[09:27] this section. “Hello there. Good morning.” So  we’re now running by the River Thames on our way  
[09:38] to Goring and Streatley. That line of Canada geese  over there, look. This is the village of South  
[09:49] Stoke. We are 25½ kilometres in. “Hello, crew. All  right? Okay.” I’ve had a cup of tea. I’ve had a  
[10:04] few spoonfuls of rice pudding. What was the other  thing? Matcha—yeah, Mission Matcha drink. And I’ve  
[10:12] got a coffee to take with me. “Me now. So we’re  in Goring.” — “Have we been here before?” — “Don’t  
[10:17] know.” — “No, don’t think so.” — “See you later.”  — “We’ve been here lots before.” So I’ve packed  
[10:24] Stephen off. He’s taken a takeaway latte and  he’s got his ice bandana on. This time we’ve put  
[10:33] a waterproof shoe cover inside the bandana so  that the ice does not leak all down the back,  
[10:40] so hopefully this will prevent chafing  issues. There’s Goring Village Hall here.  
[11:00] “Thank you.” — “Thanks.” Lovely support  through Goring here. This is another  
[11:10] iconic point on the Ridgeway during Race to the  Stones. We’re crossing now between two counties  
[11:18] and two villages: the villages of Goring behind  me and Streatley in front of me, and the counties  
[11:24] of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. So we’re crossing  between two counties over the River Thames. I’ve  
[11:33] done a few races on the Ridgeway over the past  couple of years, so I’m getting to know Goring  
[11:38] and Streatley very well. On Race to the Stones,  you’ll arrive here around 18 miles into the race.  
[11:48] There’s an extra water station just here set up  especially for today’s race. “Hi, guys. Becca,  
[11:55] explain why you’re here today doing the 50K.”  — “Well, I haven’t done an ultra before—done a  
[12:00] few marathons—and I watched this guy’s video  when I was on the cusp of signing up and it  
[12:04] tipped me over the edge.” — “So really, it’s  your favourite.” — “What are you hoping for  
[12:09] today?” — “I’m really just hoping for a great  experience, you know? Yeah, I don’t really have a  
[12:14] time in mind. If I come in around sort of six to  eight hours, that’s what I put—be very happy. But  
[12:19] mainly I want to finish feeling good, and  that might encourage me to do another, you  
[12:23] know? That’s what it’s all about.” — “That’s the  plan. Thank you.” — “Thanks, Becca. Well done.”  
[12:41] Just over 35K in. The sun is high in the sky. It’s  a beautiful day. Gorgeous view as well. “Cheers,  
[12:50] buddy.” — “Thank you.” — “No worries.” 4 hours 38  minutes—but we don’t care about time today. Just  
[13:02] about 15 km from halfway and base camp—let’s  get some food and some drinks. 7.2 km to the  
[13:16] next water stop and crew. Let’s get on our way.  Right, this is approximately 43 kilometres in.  
[13:26] I’ve stopped. I’ve got well over an hour before  I see Stephen—having a nice prawn salad. There  
[13:33] are loads and loads of people here. I’ll let  you have a look. Last year I finished Race to  
[13:39] the Stones in just over 13 hours. I knew from  the start that if I was going to enjoy my day,  
[13:46] this year would have to be slower. I deliberately  adjusted my expectations to account for the  
[13:51] conditions. And if you’re just starting out  in ultrarunning, it’s important that you think  
[13:56] about what you want to achieve and why. For me,  I’d rather run happy than miserable and hurting,  
[14:03] and I’d rather finish the race in a slower time  than DNF trying to push harder for a fast time.  
[14:13] 5 hours 51 minutes and we’ve just hit  a marathon—42.2 kilometres. Just coming  
[14:20] up to a water stop and meeting my wife,  who is crewing me today. “Beautiful views  
[14:28] up on the ridge here, buddy.” — “How  are you doing?” — “Yeah, not too bad,  
[14:42] thanks. I’m enjoying a nice cup of tea.” I’ve  got no idea at this stage what Stephen’s going  
[14:48] to want when he comes here. We’ve got little  mini sweet peppers—that’s probably more for  
[14:55] me than for Stephen—got tomatoes—again,  probably more for me—tea, more sun cream.  
[15:11] So look at all the support we have at the car park  here. Fantastic. “Thank you.” — “So I’ve got ice  
[15:25] in my hat, I’ve got ice in my bandana and I’ve got  ice here in my legs, and I’ve got a Lucozade to  
[15:39] drink.” Loads of crew meeting their runners high  up on the ridge. “No, I’m good, thank you. Thank  
[15:47] you very much, though—appreciate it.” — “Bye,  guys.” — “I’m all right. Thank you very much,  
[15:54] though—much appreciated.” So nice—the camaraderie  between the runners and the crew. We are walking.  
[16:02] We’re making the most of the fact that there’s  no time pressure today. I’m not trying to beat  
[16:09] any goals. 7K to the halfway base camp. “Well  done, guys.” — “Yeah.” — “Who’s quitting at  
[16:21] 50K?” — “Nobody.” One of the best things about  Race to the Stones for beginners to trail running,  
[16:27] but also for those wanting to run fast, is that  90% of the terrain is smooth running—either chalk  
[16:34] or grass or dry dirt trails. So you’re worrying a  lot less about tripping, falling, getting injured,  
[16:42] and spending more time enjoying the run, chatting  to other runners, taking in the atmosphere and  
[16:47] the scenery. We are 48½, nearly 49 km in to  Race to the Stones, and we’re just passing  
[16:58] Wantage Monument. When we pass that monument, that  means that base camp is literally half a K away,  
[17:06] and I can see it right in front of me now. So we  are nearly halfway there. So I’ve now arrived at  
[17:20] the 50K mark. I shall take you around base camp.  There’s the merchandise; it’s like burgers,  
[17:31] pizzas, coffee, ice creams. There’s a resting  place. Some people choose to do this event  
[17:44] over two days. Those people will finish today;  they’ll go to tent allocation; they’ll be told  
[17:50] what number tent they are sleeping in tonight,  and you’ll see there, over in the distance,  
[17:55] all the tents lined up with all the bags. There  are Posh Wash showers. If anybody wants to know  
[18:01] what a Posh Wash shower is: it’s basically just a  warm shower. It’s a clean cubicle, unlike at many  
[18:10] events. So here’s everybody’s bags, and you’ll  see all the tents have got numbers on. Looks like  
[18:16] there are some posh tents at the back. Look at  this, though—you can use the hair straighteners,  
[18:23] hair dryers. Good Lord. 1:15 in the afternoon,  and the bar is already popular. So runners come up  
[18:35] through the flags now. Some people today are doing  50 km and then they finish here. The 100 km is  
[18:43] one—I have to keep going straight through. Banana,  a bit of rice pudding, icy water. We’re all good.  
[19:02] And look at that view. And some ginger ale to  take with me. So, shall we finish here? Should  
[19:18] we go and do 50K today and call it a day? No. No.  There we go. Okay, here’s Pit Stop—3, 4—4. Yeah,  
[19:40] that looks like a good thing to do. It’s  absolutely perfect here. People can have  
[19:46] a meal. Some people are finishing the 50K;  they go and sleep in the tents over there,  
[19:52] and then they’ll do the second 50K tomorrow. Other  people are just chilling out under the tents,  
[19:57] under the gazebos there, just relaxing. It’s  very tempting to stay too long at base camp.  
[20:04] It’s so nice, with the music playing and people  cheering, with the runners coming in to finish  
[20:10] their 50Ks. It’s a real hive of activity, and,  yeah, if you’re not careful, you can stay there  
[20:17] a bit too long and enjoy yourself a bit too  much. There is still work to be done on Race  
[20:23] to the Stones 100K. If I want to walk a bit, I  just walk a bit—it’s fine. We’re not going to  
[20:30] worry about it. If I get in after dark, it’s fine.  We’re not going to worry about it. So let’s get  
[20:36] it done. 8 hours 37 minutes—58 kilometres  in—Pit Stop 5. Need to fill up my water;  
[22:03] try and get some food down me as well. “I love  your videos.” — “Cheers, buddy. Thank you.” The  
[22:08] thing about later in the race is you don’t want  to eat, but if you can get something down you,  
[22:13] it’s good. “How’s it going?” — “Oh, hello.” —  “Right. Because I can’t really eat at this stage.”  
[22:20] We’ve got a marathon to go—just over a marathon.  I’ve got milk again, which is basically protein,  
[22:26] carbs and fat—not a lot of carbs, but a little.  “Thank you so much, guys—appreciate it.” It’s 8  
[22:35] km until I see Victoria again. I’d better fill up  my water. Doused with water; a little bit of extra  
[22:43] ice secretly stored at the aid station for anyone  who asks. And we’ve got just over a marathon to  
[22:51] go. I’m not feeling too bad, really, but it is  slow. We’re going slowly. My thinking is that  
[23:00] we’ll probably be about two or three hours slower  than last year, but that’s absolutely fine. It’s  
[23:08] just a case of managing the situation on a day  like today and just enjoying the beautiful views,  
[23:14] because this ridge and this Ridgeway trail are  just amazing—absolutely fantastic. I love it,  
[23:22] and I love the history of it. I love the fact  that this stuff that I’m walking on now, you know,  
[23:27] people 5,000 years ago were walking on this  trail. The Romans used it. It was used in the  
[23:34] Iron Age. Pilgrims used it. Travellers, soldiers.  You know, it’s just a fantastic ancient trail that  
[23:45] I absolutely adore. “Hold on, boys—keep it  going. Marathon to go.” Okay, on my watch:  
[23:52] distance remaining, 42.2. There we go—so now  officially a marathon to go on the Ridgeway on  
[24:00] Race to the Stones 2025. Absolutely loving it.  “Tell me why you’re here, Stu.” — “I am here—my  
[24:07] first 100K.” — “No, it isn’t.” — “Yeah, is it?  I’ve done plenty of 50 milers, but, yeah, this was  
[24:14] the one. I thought, well, you know, it’s a good  introductory race. It’s pretty flat.” — “And you  
[24:20] are currently an hour ahead of me. You started  at 7:30?” — “Yeah—half seven.” — “Well done,  
[24:24] you. What are the goals for the future, then?” —  “Oh, a few shorter races coming up: Jurassic Coast  
[24:32] Maverick Race in October, and then the Hurtwood  50K. And then maybe Hong Kong in January.” — “Oh,  
[24:38] brilliant.” — “He’s not allowed to see this.” —  “I want to do the Hong Kong 100 because I’ve got  
[24:41] a friend who lives in Singapore; we were going to  meet there.” — “Amazing.” — “Yeah.” — “Cheers.”  
[24:48] — “Thank you. Carry on—keep going.” — “You’ve got  to run up that.” — “You’ve got to run up that hill  
[24:52] now, is it?” — “Yeah.” — “Thank you very much.”  — “I’m all right.” — “Who are you?” — “I’m James  
[24:58] Simpson, but I’m a fan of your channel, so keep  up the good work and well done.” — “Cheers, buddy.  
[25:02] Thank you very much. See you later.” It’s nearly  3 pm—66½ K mark. The sun is still shining. Not  
[25:22] quite sure what time I’ll see Stephen, but he’s  behind last year’s pace, and that’s absolutely  
[25:29] understandable. He’s enjoying the day. And we’ll  wait. 62 kilometres in. We’re on White Horse Hill  
[25:41] now. Castle remnants up there on the hill, and on  the other side of that hill is a big white horse,  
[25:47] which unfortunately we’re not going to see.  9 hours 24 minutes for that: 62 kilometres—38  
[25:54] or so to go. You can just make out the different  sections of the ramparts of the castle up there.  
[26:29] Stephen’s just phoned me to say he fancies having  a cup of tea when he sees me. So I’m just boiling  
[26:36] the kettle. I’ll make a flask of tea for him,  a mug of tea for me. I’m also going to make  
[26:43] one of these up—it’s just a sachet of hydration  powder, bit of orange flavour in it—mix it with  
[26:51] cold milk and a dash of honey. “Need ice in my  hat, don’t I, as well.” Applied a load more sun  
[27:10] cream. “Yeah. Cup of tea. Milk.” — “Yeah.” — “And  I’ve got a Lucozade to go with.” — “Got another  
[27:17] ice bandana. Let’s go.” — “Okay.” — “Thanks,  Vic.” — “Love you too.” Right—ice in my shorts,  
[27:25] ice on my back. 66 km, and it’s about 6K to  the next pit stop. “I bought Stephen some mint  
[27:33] Cornettos. He wasn’t very grateful for them, so  I’m working my way through them.” 66 kilometres  
[27:43] is just over 41 miles, and it’s around now when  your legs might start feeling a little heavy; your  
[27:51] joints might be aching, muscles feeling tired, and  your feet a little beaten up. This is definitely  
[27:57] where I feel the benefit of the extra cushioning  in my Hokas and the energy return in the Enertor  
[28:03] insoles. They just keep you moving that little  bit longer, feeling slightly less trashed than  
[28:09] you might otherwise be. If you want to give  them a try, check the link in the description.  
[28:39] I wasn’t going to see Victoria till 86K, but  she phoned me and said, “I’m at 72K.” So here  
[28:45] she is. So I’ve got an ice cream, which is good.  I’ve put some more ice in my shorts and my hat,  
[28:51] and we’re good to go. “And I get extra wife  points.” — “Right, see you later.” — “Love  
[28:57] you too.” — “See ya.” “Hello.” — “Hello.” —  “Welcome to festival.” — “Thank you.” So we’re  
[29:11] at Pit Stop 6, which is 72-ish kilometres.  It’s that time where you don’t really know  
[29:17] what you want. You’ve done the hard part—now  there are just some more hard parts to come.  
[29:30] “How’s it going, bud?” — “Yeah, good. How  are you?” — “Do you know what? Surprisingly  
[29:35] good.” — “Good. You look good—fresh.” —  “Well, just—maybe.” — “Is that considered  
[29:42] assistance?” — “No.” — “I’ll push you  back down if you need.” — “Cheers, guys.”  
[29:55] While we’re climbing this big hill, I hope  you’ve noticed that I am actually wearing  
[30:01] a different Flying Burrito shirt today. I love  my yellow one, but I’ve worn it loads, so today  
[30:08] I thought I’d wear this—purple/mauve-coloured  check Flying Burrito shirt. And it is—I don’t  
[30:16] know if you can see—it is a branded one: Film  My Run on the side. So we need to put massive  
[30:24] pressure on Flying Burrito to produce these for  anyone who wants them. So go and check out the  
[30:32] link in the description if you want one of these  for yourself. There are lots of different colours  
[30:37] and male and female shirts, so go and check out  flyingburrito.eu and use my code, which you’ll  
[30:45] find in the description of the video, to get  yourself a Flying Burrito shirt. You too can  
[30:51] be the best-dressed man or woman on the trails.  And if you’re not subscribed to the channel,  
[31:01] please go and do that now—much appreciated. And  make sure—because this is all that YouTube cares  
[31:08] about—is you watching to the end. Watch to see  me cross the finish line at the end, and I’ll be  
[31:14] eternally grateful. It will really help that good  old YouTube algorithm. Thank you so much. You may  
[31:24] be wondering why I’m not wearing a backpack or  hydration vest, and it’s because, unlike many  
[31:29] other ultra-distance races around the country,  Race to the Stones doesn’t have a mandatory kit  
[31:35] list, so you’re not required to carry anything.  Given there are regular pit stops en route,  
[31:42] and I had my wife crewing me as well, I felt I’d  have enough support on course to manage without  
[31:47] the need for much else. I carried a soft flask of  water, but that was all I needed between support  
[31:53] points. “Emily, why are you here today?” — “Good  question. Myself and my friend sign up for races  
[32:05] every year, and we decided to sign up for this  one after doing Race to the King a couple of years  
[32:10] ago.” — “Okay, so I’ve noticed you running up the  hills and then walking the flats—what on earth is  
[32:19] going on there?” — “I’m not sure. I don’t think  that will be what I do now, but I find it easier  
[32:25] to just get up the top of the hills as quickly as  possible. I come from Devon, so it’s just rolling  
[32:34] hills.” — “Used to, yeah. Well, good luck, guys.”  — “Thanks.” These are some extra water stops you  
[32:52] might have seen me filling up on the way. These  have been put in because of the weather today,  
[32:57] so these wouldn’t normally be here on  your average, everyday Race to the Stones,  
[33:01] but we’re very grateful that they’re there today.  “All right?” — “Yeah, good.” — “There we go. 12½  
[33:15] hours in. Me and Dan have just hit 80K—20 to go.”  “It’s 25 past six. I’m at the 84-kilometre marker.  
[33:28] This will be the last time I see Stephen before  the finish line. I’ve just had a sandwich. I’m  
[33:34] having a cup of tea. I’ve made Stephen a flask  of tea. I don’t think I’ll have an awful lot  
[33:42] here. I’ve got a couple of gels just to give  him a little bit of a boost for the end.”  
[33:58] Okay. It’s a case of run-walk, walk-run for the  last 18 kilometres. We’re trying to run where we  
[34:07] can. It’s still difficult, though, to get moving  once you stop running. Starting again takes some  
[34:16] mental fortitude to get going, but we will in  a minute. This is Ogbourne St George at 82 km.  
[34:34] Badgers Rest there is for sale if you want to come  and live on the Ridgeway. “Oh, hello. I didn’t  
[34:40] expect you for another three kilometres.” — “Well,  it’s nice to see you. I’ll see you in a bit.”  
[34:50] Okay—final stop with Victoria at the  van. But I’ve just had a ginger ale can,  
[34:59] cup of tea and another iced matcha latte.  
[35:14] “Sam, isn’t this incredible? See, if I’d finished  earlier, I wouldn’t get to see this.” The sun is  
[35:50] still not setting. We are 13 hours 38 minutes  in, but the scenery is incredible. Isn’t it  
[36:00] just gorgeous? Total blue skies—well, there are  a few wispy clouds up there—but it’s gorgeous,  
[36:08] isn’t it? Absolutely beautiful. And if you  come and do Race to the Stones, you never know,  
[36:15] you might get a day like this as well. It’s  been fantastic, and we’ve still got 14K to  
[36:22] go. Pit Stop 7—we’re not going in. No need.  We’ve got a water stop, if we want it, in 3K,  
[36:31] which is fabulous, but let’s just get this  done now. Let’s get this done. 12K to go,  
[36:43] and in the beautiful evening sunlight we see  Barbury Castle, Iron Age hill fort. There are  
[36:50] loads of hill forts on the Ridgeway, so if you’re  ever on the Ridgeway, be sure to look out for  
[36:56] them. Just coming to the other side of it—the  big circle that we’re in the middle of now.  
[37:02] Barbury Castle dates from around 700 BC and is  part of a chain of hill forts along or near the  
[37:08] Ridgeway. Others include Liddington, Uffington  and Martinsell. These forts controlled movement,  
[37:16] trade, territorial boundaries and served as  refuges along the route. There’s evidence the  
[37:21] fort here on Barbury Hill was used later by the  Romans and was even used by the American military  
[37:27] during World War II. So this important site  deserves its scheduled status. There can’t be  
[37:34] many more classic English scenes than rolling  hills on a summer’s day—the farmer working  
[37:44] in his field down in the valley. Absolutely  amazing. It’s just been a complete treat today.  
[38:00] At this stage, it really is just a mental  battle. You’ve got to force yourself to keep  
[38:06] moving forward. Everything in your body and your  mind is telling you you want to stop. You’ve just  
[38:12] got to keep going. 6K to go. It’s 9 o’clock. I’m  at the finish line, and whilst I’m waiting for Mr  
[38:23] C’s imminent arrival, I’m having a cheeky pork  noodle—but don’t tell him. With 5 km to go,  
[38:32] if you listen carefully you can hear  the announcer at the finish line,  
[38:36] because you’re actually only about 2 km away  as the crow flies. This is the little sting in  
[38:42] the tail you get from Race to the Stones. You  quite literally run to the Stones in Avebury,  
[38:47] but then you turn around and come back out again  to get to the finish line. You really won’t get  
[38:54] lost on a Threshold event. There are plenty of  arrows pointing you in the right direction at  
[39:01] all times. And we have just turned to go down the  hill and into Avebury. 4.3 kilometres remaining.  
[39:20] So I’m now walking up the road with a GoPro  battery for Stephen—his camera’s died;  
[39:27] he can’t film the finish line unless I go  out and meet him. And these are Avebury  
[39:35] Stones—2K to go. So anyone who does Race to  the Stones, this is the dreaded moment—oh,  
[39:44] it’s a brilliant moment because you get to go  around the cone. There are the Stones—Avebury  
[39:53] stone circle. We have less than 2K to go to  finish, but we’ve got to go back down here  
[39:58] now and then across the field. 1 km to go.  Finish is there. But this is a very gnarly  
[40:11] field—400 metres of field, 600 metres of farm  road. What a beautiful, difficult, gorgeous,  
[40:26] challenging yet fantastic day it’s been at  Race to the Stones 2025. We are on the farm  
[40:33] track with 200 metres to go to the finish  line, and it feels fantastic. Please don’t  
[40:39] forget to subscribe to the channel. Thank you for  watching right to the end of the run. We are going  
[40:45] to finish. We’re going to do it under 16 hours  which, to be honest, I’m fairly pleased with.  
[40:55] There we go—finish. Great finish. Well done. 100  kilometres in the bag. Thank you very much indeed.
