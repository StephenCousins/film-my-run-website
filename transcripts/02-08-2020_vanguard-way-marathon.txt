[00:23] all right so this is the vanguard way
[00:25] marathon i did this four years ago it
[00:27] was my
[00:27] longest time ever for america so let's
[00:30] see how it goes today
[00:31] we are in lloyd park in croydon this is
[00:35] south london we're gonna do a 13 miles
[00:39] out through the fields the parks the
[00:42] woodland all the way out
[00:44] south of london we're going to cross the
[00:46] m25 motorway
[00:47] and then we're going to turn around and
[00:48] come exactly the same way back to
[00:50] lloyd's park
[00:57] [Music]
[01:10] oh
[01:25] 40 minutes gone and we are
[01:29] four and a half miles seven kilometers
[01:31] in to the vanguard way marathon
[01:33] beautiful little
[01:35] wooded area here
[01:44] [Music]
[02:06] so
[02:14] very steep hill just got to be careful
[02:17] on your way down it
[02:18] easy to slip but look how beautiful it
[02:21] is here eve
[02:22] even with the m25 below us
[02:45] so i am 18.3 kilometers
[02:49] into the vanguard way marathon one hour
[02:52] 46 minutes
[02:54] and there's first and second place in
[02:56] the marathon just gone past on the way
[02:59] [Music]
[03:02] back
