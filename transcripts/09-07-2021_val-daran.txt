TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

That was the hardest race I have ever ever
done. This is the first running of the Val D'Aran
100 by UTMB. In true UTMB style, the start/finish line
is right next to a little quaint village church. It's very small. Everything is compacted into a few metres. So registration and bib collection, literally
50 metres that way, beyond the start/finish line. There is an information point just here and
then we have the presentation area just in front of me here. And so this is pretty much the hub of all
the activity here in Vielha, which is where the 100 mile race begins in less than seven
hours. It's an hour and 20 minutes before race starts
and I'm just going to hand my bag in. So this is a bag that gets picked up at about
100k I think, into the race. Just spare stuff and food and things like
that, that I might need. It's really really hot, so we've got to keep
cool. I'm very nervous, really nervous, I have to
say. Hello, welcome to Film My Run, my name's Stephen. Here we are in Vielha. We're going to run 100 miles in the Val D'Aran
100 miler by UTMB. 10 thousand metres of ascent, we've got 48 hours in which to do it. I'm really nervous about this one. Wish me luck! So this is what you find in UTMB races. We're only four and a half kilometres in. There are so many people that we've basically
just come to a standstill. And this happens at every UTMB race anywhere
in the world. First checkpoint. Two hours and six minutes. 800 metres climbed. Nearly 11 kilometres done. What a view. Look at that! 14 kilometres in and this is the top of the
first climb. Absolutely amazing. Before the sun goes down. So this is the top of mainland Spain, this
mountain up here. Aneto, thank you. Right, six hours and 37 minutes in. So this aid station is the third aid station
and it closes in about 35 minutes. So we're not not too far inside the cutoff. We've got a very big long climb now. It's half past midnight, 20 to 1 in the morning. So I've got some soup and I'm going to get
some bread and I won't spend too long in here now. So we've done about 38 kilometres. Just come up a huge climb from the last aid
station and then down again. You probably can see the lights behind me. And then we're going up again. It's about another nine kilometres to the
next aid station. It's five to three in the morning. So we've been going eight hours, 55 minutes. 38 kilometres. So you can see morning is just starting to
break. We've done 50 kilometres in 11 hours 55 minutes. So we're well over a quarter of the way there. Almost a third of the way there. I don't feel too bad. Starting to get a bit tired with these climbs
now. We've had some really tough climbs, but we’re
getting there. Next aid station is about 7k away. All right, nearly 57 kilometres in. I've got pasta in my bowl. I've got black coffee. I think my quads got a bit trashed on the
downhill into this aid station. This is Bossost, I think. It's 55 kilometres officially. I've been here a while now actually. I think. I've almost been here half an hour maybe. 13 hours 29 minutes on the clock, so I better
get going shortly. So we are here at Canejan. 64 kilometres,
although I've got 66 on my watch, and we have 5.8 kilometres to the next aid station, which
is Toran. And then we have the monster climb of the
whole run. 17 hours 55. We are now on the biggest climb of the race. It's a 1500 meter climb up the side of this
mountain. Beautiful blue lake down there look. We are 75 kilometres in. We are still slogging our way up this 1500
meter climb. We're in the last 300 metres of the climb
now. Every time we come across a little stream,
we're all throwing ourselves under it to keep cool, because it's really hot. So we are 20 hours and 24 minutes in to the
Val D’Aran 100. We've covered 80 kilometres. So we are halfway. That seems amazing that it's only halfway,
but there we are. It's more of a long slow hike than a run,
this event. That's pretty fantastic isn't it?! and that's what's forming all the streams and waterfalls down in the valley That is beautiful. Gracias All right, so the previous shot you just saw
was taken in a pass between the mountains, and that's where it is right up there. You see that v-shape at the top, that's where
we've just come down from. 95 kilometres and 25 hours 11 minutes. My quads, I don't know if I've mentioned this,
my quads are absolutely shot. So it's very difficult to run downhill. I can run on the flat and I can make my way
slowly uphill, but running downhill is really, really painful and we've still got 75…..65
kilometres to go. There we are. So the sun's definitely gone in. It'll be getting dark soon. I'm just making my way to the aid station
with my drop bag in at 103 kilometres officially. I am very, very tired. I'm rapidly losing patience with this race. So hard. There's still a lot of work to do overnight,
for the second night, and it looks like I'm going to be finishing between 44 and 48 hours. So this is where you get your drop bags and
basically spend a bit of time getting changed, which I've done already. I've eaten, I've got changed, I'm ready for
the night section. Although I'm not really ready, I’m absolutely
shattered. Apparently, over 300 people have withdrawn,
DNF’d. It is a beast of a race. That's where you get the food over there. There's hot pasta and things like that if
you want it and all the usual sandwiches and fruits and things and then there's other areas
where people are sitting as well. But so many people have withdrawn, there's
not many people about, and I'm going to be on my own on the hills tonight I think. Anyway, let's get going. So the sun's coming up. I feel sick. Had enough of this race. Still 20 miles to go. You can't deny that it's really beautiful
though. But having been up for two nights now, stomach
feeling a bit funny, feet hurting, legs completely trashed, and the gnarliest course you've ever
seen in your life, I am not feeling it at the moment Okay like an idiot, as I always do, I failed
to look at the information correctly and I thought this aid station was the one with
the 12:45 cut off. It's actually the next one. But we do have three hours to get there and
do it. So we've got a little climb, as you can see
on the map there, and then 968 metres all the way down. Fingers crossed we can do it Dai thinks we can do it, don't you Dai? I think we can do it. So good news, we made it to the final aid
station which has a cut-off time. And we made it with an hour to spare. So all we need to do now is have some food
and try to sort out how I'm gonna stay cool for the final section. There's one aid station in the middle of the
final section. There's a big climb and then a little climb
and then downhill into Vielha for the finish. So this has been standard fare for the past
two days. Basically trudging up a mountain, very slowly,
through a forest, and then eventually you'll come out into open land and then the mountains
or the higher mountains you'll see in the distance. We've basically done that about four times
over the course of this race. But this is the last one. Final climb and then it's down to the finish. I've got about three and a half kilometres
to go. There's Vielha down there. But my legs are absolutely rock solid. I can hardly move. From the United Kingdom, well done Stephen. What a wonderful feeling crossing the finish
line. 46 hours, 51 minutes. Ring that bell Stephen, ring that bell You made it home. Stephen's coming home. Football's coming home. That was the hardest race I have ever ever
done I'm just so glad to be back home.
