TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

it's about 11 o'clock in the morning been driving for about three hours but we're not far away now from great yarmouth which will be the finish line for the sunrise ultra which is 83 miles 133 kilometers or so which will be starting at about 3 30 this afternoon we're going to get a bus from the finish line to the start line so we can start the race and then when we get back to the finish i'll have my car to drive home so very handy norfolk is very flat we're going to be running along the norfolk coast path it's not going to be very hilly so it's just going to be a flat run for 83 miles [Music] we're at the car park at great yarmouth uh we've got half an hour before the bus leaves so i'm getting changed in the car we've got an hour's journey or an hour and a half bus journey to snetism which is where the start of the race is uh 83 miles that way um so everything i'm going to wear is on the back seat here on the back shelf here so i've got my buff hat my race belt my waterproof jacket my shorts i'm i'm wearing my top um and then my underwear as well um has as has become customary i've got some rice pudding to eat on the bus i've got a warm layer here required by mandatory kit and then everything else is in my salomon race belt my race vest here so there is uh waterproof uh trousers a waterproof jacket there um then a long sleeve top and long sleeve trousers as well um medical kits or like a you know emergency plasters and things like that um i've obviously got my hydration bottles my salomon soft flasks filtered flasks not that i'll need water filtered in norfolk but there we are uh what else have i got um various bars of food because the aid stations are some 20 miles apart on this run so unless you've got crew you are going to need to fend for yourself so i've got some bars to eat and um and some paracetamol and that is about it really um 133 kilometers i think we should be okay oh yeah obviously head torch and spare head torch and spare batteries um oh and survival blanket one of the most important if you if you need it it's one of the most important things you'll take with you um not not a space blanket but a full body bag basically a survival bag that you can put yourself in and then all that is wrapped in a waterproof container as well so that's that's my gift hello you all right not too bad [Music] so we've made it to snetism and the coast path so we need to sign in register get our number [Music] all right there i am number 11. uh we've got to have um trackers put on for this event just so they can tell where we are and also people at home can watch where we're going [Music] all right welcome to sneticion on the norfolk coast we're gonna i think we're running the whole of the norfolk coast path pretty much uh 83 miles from here all the way down to great yarmouth there are about i'd say 50 to 60 runners here um and we're starting any minute now the idea of this is that we start at sunset and if you're fast you finish before sunrise it's called the sunrise ultra look at the viewer where is the sunset uh this is dan lawson look at the difference between dan and me and dan's gonna finish about eight hours quicker than i am as well have a good one [Music] let's go in five four three two four [Music] so it's going to get dark pretty quickly so most of this run is going to be done in the dark hopefully though we'll be able to get some footage for you of the sunrise ultra [Music] what's your name uh dominic hello dominic so uh dominic um when was your first ultra first author was october 2019 the white star's jurassic coast and that was a 50k event yes so it's taking you three years is this your longest ultra so far i know i did the channel 100 in may this year fantastic yeah so this will be a walk in the park you a flat route but less than 100 miles well i don't know about that but certainly uh hopefully i can finish this one without injury so how did you manage in the 10th path 100 it was good i really really enjoyed it a bit i've had to see if i could do with a few hills in about 60 miles yeah um picked up a bit of a niggle in the knee what time did you manage uh 2308 under 24. can't complain at that no very happy with that time brilliant well have a good run don thank you very much [Music] all right so we've only done about three kilometers and uh it's it's almost dark already so head torch will be going on very shortly [Music] all right so we're five miles in to uh the sunrise ultra it is now dark although i haven't yet put my head torch on we're running through hunstanton well we're running along the coast path with promenade in stanton and i imagine that during the summer this is very pretty but it's dark and cold [Music] it's raining we're about 12 miles in [Music] it's a boardwalk for a long way and we've done about 26 kilometers so that's what 16 17 miles [Music] [Music] state stage and we're we're 27 and a half 28k in uh what time have we been running there you go something like that you know it's raining it's a bit blowy but it's all right we're getting okay and listen this is the first checkpoint i think this is what i want uh chris yeah oh actually i'll take one of those as well awesome um right yeah i need that's me done thank you [Music] right so we've gone um how far have we gone 20 28 miles 27 miles lovely christmas trees look and we're just coming up to the second checkpoint where are we now you are at wells next to sea wells next to the sea i'll have a bag of crisps if you've got anything yeah and i'll have one of those baby bells again any particular flavor um no no so i'm gonna get ready salted yeah so we've reached clay that was a hell of a journey um been running okay until i don't know about 25 miles and then it just got really muddy and very very difficult on the foot and i've walked loads of that last section but we're now at 38 miles at clay and we've got another 14 mars to the next aid station what's the time looking at him in a second um so eight hours 44 minutes i've got 63 kilometers on my watch but um it's not quite that so there we are i've got coffee here and i've got pasta here right so dan who we saw at the beginning uh dan lawson who as you know is the the jog holder is it a jog or is it joggly holds the jog okay um he is already approaching the next aid station so he's going to finish in 13 hours something like that we're looking at about 19 to 20 hours now i'm not now in any rush having just gone through all of that mud i am i'm quite happy to just take my time i'm going out in the cold and wet now does anybody want to come with me love to mate no you're staying here see you later thank you so much thank you very much for your help thank you take care bye-bye and we're off so after the mud we now have four miles of shingle beach yeah just trying to hold my camera at the same time as running it's not a good idea so we're now at the highest point of this run uh that isn't very high um but we're running along the cliffs towards chroma um we're about 45 miles shouldn't really go near the edge but there are there are definitely cliffs there you can't i it's too dark isn't it anyway it's pleasant running here after the shingle so we're down the steps and along the lower promenade it is three o'clock in the morning feeling too bad back is aching a bit but other than that actually got over my low period which was in that mud at about 20 miles that was horrendous so i've got over that i'm feeling okay there's a very bright light that just came on as i ran past it's um sea view car park wherever that is 11 hours 48 minutes and um nearly 50 miles according to my watch but probably oh [Music] we've done nearly 50 miles according to my watch but probably not 50 miles according to the official race distance and it looks like the coast path goes that way roman camp circular walk nine miles okay let's go this way i think chrome is just a little bit further on and even though it's still pitch black uh i can now hear birds singing so the birds think it's morning time really looking forward to seeing the sun come up now actually been a long night but it's only it's only just after four o'clock in the morning so it's still three hours i think of darkness [Music] that's the pier at chroma we're about 3k from the next aid station so we've made it to overstrand aid station which is 53 miles i'm reliably informed i thought it was 52 so bonus mile uh there is a there is a half sunrise happening and some of those guys are sitting here and um my my bus mate has decided to call it what's what's going on come on come on what's your excuse i'm not enjoying yeah i'm soaring too many places and doing stuff with this without a gpx file isn't it oh right if you haven't got a gpx file yes that's that's going to be yeah yeah i've got lost more times than i can count but let me tell you not all of us are enjoying it that's it so we've got about 19 kilometers to go to the next aid station and um once we're there it's then 21k home it's 6 30 in the morning here so i'm really hoping the sun comes up soon because i am i'm bush now i just like some sunshine to wake me up and give me a bit of energy morning it's 20 past seven in the morning on sunday and we're about 100k in with about 37 36 37 conferences to go but we've been walking along this beach for it seems like forever there's a cliff like a little cliff here that i can't get up and i'm just walking along the beach waiting for an opportunity to get off the beach took my head torch off as soon as i thought it was light enough to see where i was going absolutely done in now but still over 20 miles to go [Music] it's just not happening today unfortunately nothing going on in my legs backs aching still 20 miles to go at one point i was hoping i could get in about 9 00 a.m but it's um well it's probably near that now um more likely be getting in now between 1 and 2 p.m so it's going to be close to 24 hours 23 hours something like that but i'm gonna get to the end it'll just be very very slow i'm not gonna dnf that's for sure [Music] [Music] this way well the sun is out i am feeling a little bit better now running a little bit stronger i'm still not going to do anything like the time i wanted to today um it is going to be closer to like 23 hours but that's fine it's just the way it is isn't it so um [Music] i think it's about two kilometers two or three kilometers to the next checkpoint and then we've only got about 13 or 14 miles to go home or to the finish line the finish line is at the britannia pier in great yarmouth so [Music] [Music] searching for my aid station which i really hope is really not far away i've been hoping it's round the corner for the last 5k [Music] i would have walked right past that then found it here it is so this is the last aid station now so we have arrived at c pauling which is actually not the final aid station there are um one or two uh little smaller um stops but there are only 14 miles to go and that to me now my head that seems like absolutely nothing um considering what we've done and then the night we've had um it was it was a bit good hello [Music] [Music] so we've been going for 19 hours and 50 minutes we have 10 miles to go i've done 121 kilometers in 19 hours 50 minutes it's pretty slow but i am moving very slow but only 10 miles to go now 16 kilometers and we will be done looking forward to it that was really nice seeing those seals amazing [Music] lifeboats having a fundraiser that's the sign saying coast path to the right i am absolutely whacked but we are only eight kilometers from great yarmouth and the finish line of the sunrise ultra [Music] 5k to go just over 22 hours run legs aren't working anymore just trying to trot it in just over a kilometer to go in the sunrise ultra i'm gonna do it in just under 23 hours [Music] so this is it the end of like 83 or so miles [Music] [Music] [Music] so it was quite sunny um earlier on so i i took loads of clothes off but i need to get them back on again because i am going to freeze [Music] have you missed someone i missed you sir wow okay summary time so um i finished in 14th which i'm gonna have to be happy with 22 hours and about 15 minutes something like that so that'll do um it was much much harder than i expected it to be partly the weather um but also the terrain underfoot so we had shingle we had sand on the beach um we had boardwalk the worst thing was just slippery mud really really slippery mud in the early part of the race when it poured with rain that was really hard um i would argue i think giles would probably agree the race director um i wouldn't make this your first ultra maybe you could do the half as it first i wouldn't make this um your first um flat race either um you need to be up for the challenge so it's a it's a tough one i mean the weather might change if the weather's completely dry one year it might change it completely but um from what i've done um i would say you you need to be up for the challenge you need to be ready for something that is gonna hurt even you know it's not 100 it's 83 miles but that was very tough and you can see by my time okay i'm not fully trained i'm in a bit of a lure period but uh 22 nearly 23 hours for 83 miles oh oh almost flat running pretty much flat running yeah that was really really hard uh right this is giles racer except giles i was just talking to my uh other camera there and i was saying that [Music] you need to be up for the challenge for this race it's not it's not a race to be taken lightly it's not a race that you think oh it's flat i can just rock up and i'll finish it um [Music] would you recommend that people who sign up for this are experienced authorities already definitely i mean um we see it in the first time we did it the drop out rate and the it was a fifteen completion rate you know it's not it's not a common garden you know someone run along the coast the idea here is that you actually have a proper winter running experience for that you need to be comfortable operating all that weathers at night largely in the dark in all sorts of terrain the ability to navigate in that environment and that's kind of the the kind of adventure we want to put on when we set out and um don't apologize for that well i'm very happy about that and and if that's what you set out to do then that's definitely what we got yeah well thank you for an experience girls pleasure it's great you

============================================================

[00:01] it's about 11 o'clock in the morning

[00:09] yarmouth which will be the finish line
[00:11] for the
[00:13] sunrise ultra which is 83 miles
[00:16] 133 kilometers or so
[00:20] which will be starting

[00:48] it's just going to be a flat run
[00:51] for 83 miles
[00:54] [Music]

[02:25] of food because the aid stations are
[02:27] some 20 miles apart on this run
[02:31] so unless you've got crew
[02:33] you are going to need to fend for
[02:34] yourself so i've got some bars to eat
[02:37] and um and some paracetamol and that is
[02:41] about it really um
[02:43] 133 kilometers i think we should be okay
[02:47] oh yeah obviously head torch and spare
[02:49] head torch and spare batteries
[02:52] um oh and survival blanket one of the
[02:55] most important if you if you need it
[02:56] it's one of the most important things
[02:58] you'll take with you um not not a space
[03:01] blanket but a full body bag basically a
[03:04] survival bag that you can put yourself
[03:06] in
[03:08] and then all that is wrapped in a
[03:09] waterproof
[03:11] container as well

[03:34] so we need to sign in register get our
[03:37] number
[03:40] [Music]
[03:46] all right there i am number 11.
[03:49] uh we've got to have um trackers put on
[03:51] for this event
[03:54] just so they can tell where we are and
[03:56] also people at home can watch where
[03:58] we're going
[04:03] [Music]
[04:11] all right welcome to sneticion on the
[04:13] norfolk coast we're gonna i think we're
[04:16] running the whole of the norfolk coast
[04:18] path pretty much uh 83 miles from here
[04:22] all the way down to great yarmouth
[04:24] there are about i'd say 50 to 60 runners
[04:27] here um and we're starting any minute
[04:30] now the idea of this is that we start at
[04:32] sunset and if you're fast you finish
[04:35] before sunrise it's called the sunrise
[04:37] ultra
[04:39] look at the viewer
[04:41] where is the sunset

[05:13] four
[05:14] three
[05:15] two
[05:16] four
[05:18] [Music]
[05:33] so it's going to get dark pretty quickly

[06:36] hills in about 60 miles yeah um picked
[06:39] up a bit of a niggle in the knee what
[06:41] time did you manage uh 2308 under 24.

[10:13] that was a hell of a journey um been
[10:16] running okay until
[10:18] i don't know about 25 miles
[10:21] and then it just got really muddy and
[10:24] very very difficult on the foot and i've
[10:26] walked
[10:27] loads of that last section
[10:30] but we're now at 38 miles at clay and
[10:32] we've got another 14 mars to the next
[10:34] aid station
[10:36] what's the time looking at him in a
[10:38] second
[10:44] um so eight hours 44 minutes
[10:47] i've got 63 kilometers on my watch but
[10:50] um it's not quite that
[10:53] so there we are i've got coffee
[10:56] here and i've got pasta
[11:00] here
[11:02] right so dan who we saw at the beginning
[11:04] uh dan lawson who as you know is the the
[11:06] jog holder is it a jog or is it joggly
[11:09] holds
[11:11] the jog okay
[11:13] um he is already
[11:16] approaching the next aid station so he's
[11:18] going to finish in
[11:19] 13 hours something like that
[11:22] we're looking at about
[11:23] 19 to 20 hours now i'm not now in any
[11:26] rush having just gone through all of
[11:28] that mud
[11:30] i am i'm quite happy to just take my
[11:32] time
[11:34] i'm going out in the cold and wet now

[11:45] you very much for your help thank you
[11:48] take care bye-bye
[11:54] and we're off
[11:58] so after the
[12:00] mud
[12:01] we now have four miles
[12:03] of shingle beach
[12:19] yeah just trying to hold my camera at
[12:20] the same time as
[12:22] running it's not a good idea
[12:25] so we're now at the highest point of
[12:28] this run uh that isn't very high um but
[12:31] we're running along the cliffs towards
[12:33] chroma
[12:34] um we're about 45 miles
[12:44] shouldn't really go near the edge but
[12:46] there are
[12:47] there are definitely
[12:49] cliffs there you can't i it's too dark
[12:53] isn't it
[12:56] anyway it's pleasant running here after
[12:58] the shingle
[13:12] so we're down
[13:14] the steps
[13:16] and along the lower promenade
[13:21] it is three o'clock in the morning
[13:34] feeling too bad
[13:35] back is aching a bit
[13:39] but other than that actually got over my
[13:41] low period which was
[13:43] in that mud at about 20 miles
[13:46] that was horrendous
[13:48] so i've got over that i'm feeling okay
[13:55] there's a very bright light that just
[13:56] came on as i ran past it's um sea view
[14:00] car park wherever that is
[14:04] 11 hours 48 minutes
[14:07] and um
[14:08] nearly 50 miles according to my watch
[14:12] but probably oh
[14:14] [Music]
[14:19] we've done nearly 50 miles according to
[14:21] my watch but probably not 50 miles
[14:23] according to
[14:24] the official race distance
[14:29] and it looks like the coast path goes
[14:32] that way
[14:33] roman camp circular walk nine miles
[14:37] okay let's go this way
[14:48] i think chrome is just a little bit
[14:50] further on
[14:55] and
[14:56] even though it's still pitch black
[14:59] uh i can now hear birds singing so the
[15:02] birds think it's morning time
[15:06] really looking forward to seeing the sun
[15:08] come up now actually
[15:12] been a long night
[15:14] but it's only
[15:16] it's only just after four o'clock in the
[15:17] morning so
[15:19] it's still
[15:20] three hours i think of darkness
[15:23] [Music]
[15:33] that's the pier at chroma
[15:38] we're about 3k from the next aid station
[15:48] so we've made it to overstrand aid
[15:50] station which is 53 miles i'm reliably
[15:54] informed i thought it was 52 so bonus
[15:56] mile
[15:57] uh
[15:59] there is a there is a half
[16:01] sunrise
[16:03] happening and some of those guys are
[16:05] sitting here
[16:06] and um
[16:08] my my bus mate has decided to call it
[16:11] what's what's going on
[16:14] come on
[16:15] come on what's your excuse i'm not
[16:18] enjoying yeah i'm soaring too many
[16:19] places and doing stuff with this without
[16:21] a gpx file isn't it oh right if you
[16:24] haven't got a gpx file yes that's that's
[16:26] going to be
[16:27] yeah yeah i've got lost more times than
[16:29] i can count but let me tell you
[16:31] not all of us are enjoying it that's it
[16:40] so we've got about 19 kilometers to go
[16:43] to the next aid station
[16:45] and um
[16:47] once we're there
[16:49] it's then 21k
[16:51] home
[16:56] it's 6 30 in the morning here
[17:00] so i'm really hoping the sun comes up
[17:02] soon because i am i'm bush now
[17:05] i just like some sunshine to wake me up
[17:08] and give me a bit of energy
[17:15] morning
[17:16] it's 20 past seven in the morning
[17:20] on sunday
[17:23] and
[17:25] we're about 100k in
[17:29] with
[17:30] about 37 36 37 conferences to go
[17:37] but
[17:38] we've been walking along this beach for
[17:40] it seems like forever
[17:43] there's a cliff like a little cliff here
[17:45] that i can't get up
[17:48] and i'm just walking along the beach
[17:50] waiting
[17:51] for an opportunity to get off the beach
[18:00] took my head torch off as soon as i
[18:02] thought it was light enough to see where
[18:04] i was going
[18:08] absolutely done in now but still over 20
[18:10] miles to go
[18:13] [Music]
[18:36] it's just not happening today
[18:37] unfortunately
[18:42] nothing going on in my legs
[18:44] backs aching
[18:46] still 20 miles to go
[18:49] at one point i was hoping i could get in
[18:51] about 9 00 a.m
[18:54] but it's um well it's probably
[18:57] near that now
[18:59] um
[19:00] more likely be getting in now between 1
[19:03] and 2 p.m
[19:04] so it's going to be close to 24 hours 23
[19:07] hours something like that
[19:10] but i'm gonna get to the end
[19:12] it'll just be very very slow
[19:14] i'm not gonna dnf that's for sure
[19:18] [Music]
[19:30] [Music]
[19:41] this way
[19:44] well the sun is out
[19:49] i am
[19:50] feeling a little bit better now
[19:53] running a little bit stronger
[19:55] i'm still not going to do anything like
[19:57] the time i wanted to today
[20:00] um it is going to be closer to like 23
[20:03] hours
[20:06] but that's fine it's just the way it is
[20:08] isn't it
[20:09] so um
[20:09] [Music]
[20:12] i think it's about two
[20:14] kilometers two or three kilometers to
[20:16] the next checkpoint
[20:18] and then we've only got about 13 or 14
[20:21] miles to go
[20:23] home
[20:25] or to the finish line the finish line is
[20:26] at the britannia pier in great yarmouth
[20:29] so
[20:31] [Music]
[20:40] [Music]
[20:44] searching for my aid station
[20:46] which
[20:47] i really hope is
[20:50] really not far away
[20:54] i've been hoping it's round the corner
[20:56] for the last 5k
[21:01] [Music]
[21:04] i would have walked right past that then
[21:07] found it
[21:08] here it is
[21:10] so this is the last aid station now
[21:15] so we have arrived at c pauling which is
[21:18] actually not the final aid station there
[21:20] are um one or two uh little
[21:23] smaller um stops
[21:25] but there are only 14 miles to go and
[21:28] that to me now my head that seems like
[21:30] absolutely nothing
[21:32] um
[21:33] considering what we've done and then the
[21:35] night we've had
[21:37] um
[21:39] it was it was a bit good
[21:42] hello
[21:52] [Music]
[22:03] [Music]
[22:11] so
[22:12] we've been going for
[22:14] 19 hours and 50 minutes
[22:16] we have 10 miles to go i've done 121
[22:19] kilometers in 19 hours 50 minutes
[22:23] it's pretty slow
[22:24] but i am moving very slow
[22:26] but only 10 miles to go now
[22:29] 16 kilometers
[22:30] and we will be done
[22:33] looking forward to it that was really
[22:34] nice seeing those seals amazing
[22:39] [Music]
[22:46] lifeboats having a fundraiser
[22:48] that's the sign
[22:49] saying coast path
[22:51] to the right
[22:55] i am absolutely whacked
[22:59] but we are only eight kilometers from
[23:02] great yarmouth
[23:03] and the finish line
[23:05] of the sunrise ultra
[23:08] [Music]
[23:14] 5k to go
[23:16] just over 22 hours
[23:19] run
[23:21] legs aren't working anymore
[23:23] just trying to trot it in
[23:27] just over a kilometer to go
[23:30] in the sunrise ultra
[23:32] i'm gonna do it in just under 23 hours
[23:40] [Music]
[23:44] so this is it
[23:46] the end of like 83 or so miles
[24:03] [Music]
[24:15] [Music]
[24:25] [Music]
[24:30] so it was quite sunny um earlier on so i
[24:33] i took loads of clothes off but i need
[24:36] to get them back on again because i am
[24:37] going to freeze
[24:39] [Music]
[24:41] have you missed someone
[24:43] i missed you sir wow
[24:48] okay summary time so um i finished in
[24:51] 14th which i'm gonna have to be happy
[24:54] with 22 hours and about 15 minutes
[24:56] something like that
[24:59] so that'll do um it was much much harder
[25:03] than i expected it to be partly the
[25:05] weather
[25:06] um
[25:07] but also the terrain underfoot so we had
[25:10] shingle we had sand on the beach
[25:13] um we had boardwalk
[25:16] the worst thing was just slippery mud
[25:18] really really slippery mud
[25:21] in the early part of the race when it
[25:23] poured with rain
[25:25] that was really hard
[25:27] um i would argue i think giles would
[25:30] probably agree the race director
[25:33] um
[25:34] i wouldn't make this your first ultra
[25:36] maybe you could do the half as it first
[25:38] i wouldn't make this um your first um
[25:43] flat race either
[25:44] um
[25:46] you need to be up for the challenge so
[25:48] it's a it's a tough one i mean the
[25:50] weather might change if the weather's
[25:51] completely dry one year it might change
[25:53] it completely
[25:55] but um from what i've done um
[25:58] i would say you you need to be up for
[26:00] the challenge you need to be
[26:01] ready for something that is gonna hurt
[26:05] even you know it's not 100 it's 83 miles
[26:09] but that
[26:10] was very tough and you can see by my
[26:12] time okay i'm not fully trained i'm in a
[26:14] bit of a lure period but uh 22
[26:17] nearly 23 hours for 83 miles
[26:21] oh oh
[26:22] almost flat running pretty much flat
[26:24] running
[26:26] yeah that was really really hard uh
[26:29] right this is giles racer except giles i
[26:30] was just talking to my uh other camera
[26:33] there and i was saying that
[26:36] [Music]
[26:38] you need to be up for the challenge for
[26:39] this race it's not it's not a race to be
[26:42] taken lightly it's not a race that you
[26:44] think oh it's flat i can just rock up
[26:46] and i'll finish it
[26:47] um
[26:48] [Music]
[26:49] would you recommend that people who sign
[26:51] up for this are experienced authorities
[26:53] already definitely i mean um we see it
[26:56] in the first time we did it the
[26:57] drop out rate and the it was a fifteen
[26:59] completion rate you know it's not it's
[27:01] not a common garden you know
[27:03] someone run along the coast the idea
[27:05] here is that you actually
[27:07] have a proper winter running experience
[27:09] for that you need to be comfortable
[27:10] operating all that weathers at night
[27:13] largely in the dark in all sorts of
[27:15] terrain the ability to navigate in that
[27:16] environment and that's kind of the the
[27:18] kind of adventure we want to put on when
[27:20] we set out and um don't apologize for
[27:22] that well i'm very happy about that and
[27:24] and if that's what you set out to do
[27:26] then that's definitely what we got yeah
[27:28] well thank you for an experience girls
[27:31] pleasure it's great
[28:10] you
