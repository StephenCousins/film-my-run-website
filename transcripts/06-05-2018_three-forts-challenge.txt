[00:01] good morning everybody we have the three
[00:03] false marason hearing worthy on a
[00:06] gorgeous sunny day
[00:07] nice been a breeze Co everything
[00:12] [Music]
[00:32] [Applause]
[00:37] [Music]
[00:42] so this is Paul sergeant you might
[00:43] remember Paul sergeant from a few weeks
[00:45] ago when we filmed the Southend pier
[00:47] marathon finished it in two 248 what are
[00:51] you going for today Paul just they were
[00:53] freer they could be realistic
[00:54] how are you gonna cope with the heat
[00:56] today what do you do - myself for a bit
[00:59] of alternatives try and catch a shade
[01:01] where I can watch him win the race in
[01:03] nonchalant style okay this is Paul and
[01:29] Josh now Paul and Josh some stupid
[01:34] reason have chosen this as their first
[01:36] first marathon is a thousand meters of
[01:39] ascent for God's sake listen it is your
[01:53] first marathon
[01:54] American first time finishing is
[01:56] absolutely the thing you should do don't
[01:59] worry about side just get it done
[02:05] welcome to film I run this is Sunday
[02:07] morning we are here for the 3/4
[02:10] challenge 2018 Richard's going for a
[02:13] ridiculously fast time even though we've
[02:15] got translocated next week I'm just
[02:17] gonna chill out and enjoy the sunshine
[02:20] [Music]
[02:50] [Applause]
[02:51] [Music]
[02:56] so this is cardiac Hill which is about a
[02:59] mile just a under a mile into the 3/4
[03:02] challenge there's no way I'm running up
[03:05] this steep hill this early in the race
[03:06] so I'm just gonna enjoy the views
[03:10] [Music]
[03:23] so the reason that this is called the
[03:26] three forts challenge is because during
[03:27] the race we passed three Iron Age forts
[03:31] and the first one is just here
[03:34] this is this is sister e-ring and the
[03:40] reason is called three forts challenge
[03:42] and not 3/4 marathon it's because
[03:45] technically it's a little bit further
[03:47] than American
[03:48] [Music]
[04:08] so with five miles into the Three Forks
[04:11] challenge that's Coons farm down there
[04:15] and the quarry in the distance
[04:19] you hope to Devil's doc
[04:21] [Music]
[04:31] for the right station actor 11
[04:34] kilometers in
[04:36] [Music]
[04:40] so this is beading hills and this is
[04:43] then about seven miles into the
[04:47] three-fourths challenge if you're doing
[04:49] the South Downs Way 100 this is 61 miles
[04:52] in it's a long climb now up to Devil's
[04:56] Dyke how many masses have you done Dave
[05:00] fine and there why did you choose this
[05:03] one is it low brilliantly the same
[05:06] things maybe two years ago and this I
[05:09] did it look like
[05:11] [Music]
[05:17] what's your name on paper until joggers
[05:23] speak this is Luke 1103 for you've done
[05:29] this three times
[05:35] as is always the case in pretty much
[05:38] every race I do all sergeants in the
[05:40] lead everyone
[05:43] [Music]
[05:44] currently second in the
[05:49] [Music]
[06:03] so this is the aid station at the
[06:05] turnaround point at Devils Dyke Devils
[06:08] Dyke is the second of our fine edge
[06:10] forts on the three-fourths challenge so
[06:14] but this is not some this is not part of
[06:16] my point because we've got another
[06:18] little bit to go
[06:22] [Music]
[06:36] [Applause]
[06:40] okay we're just about the halfway point
[06:42] now 2012 minutes so she's looking like a
[06:48] four and a half hour mouth and finish so
[06:55] this is the youth hostel at the top of
[06:57] the beading hill
[07:01] [Music]
[07:01] [Applause]
[07:03] [Music]
[07:03] [Applause]
[07:04] [Music]
[07:11] this is one of the best taps on the
[07:14] South Downs way you ever had a problem
[07:16] with water get yourself here doing your
[07:19] hang I know where we go again where you
[07:35] can assure them by see ways were think
[07:39] that way is bright

[07:48] and we've just climbed through the
[07:51] village called Anning turn and we just
[07:53] now had it up on the South Downs way

[07:57] hill beautiful day beautiful views can't
