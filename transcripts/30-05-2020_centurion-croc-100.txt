if your friend in 2020 across the world friends and families were torn apart communities they're fractured by an invisible enemy but this is a story about coming together about an adventure designed to beat the separation and loneliness one community no longer bound by convention but by a shared passion set out on a journey and together during the global lockdown they were set free [Music] welcome to film my run for the Centurion running one community event or croc and it's known and Victoria's running the beachy head marathon today and that's just a start my adventure hopefully I can run a little bit further beautiful day on the South Bend we started the beachhead marathon it's a Bo Peep car park which is kind of half way around and then we're kind of do the whole loop and come back Centurions one community event attracted some 4,000 runners and walkers from all over the world distances from 5k to 100 miles could be completed over a week either at home on a treadmill or outdoors on road or trail we're heading down into the village of Lillington and then we are going to be going all the way through this wooded area here to West Dean and then through 2xe act and then up the hills over there where you see is the start climbing the Seven Sisters the village is actually called littling ttan and that wooded area I mentioned is Freeston forest it's also debatable whether it's pronounced XE at or exit regardless the cook Muir Valley is stunning and we continued to run on to the Seven Sisters Hills and headed towards the Bell to lighthouse before reaching beachy head itself [Music] you don't actually see on the beach ahead marathon is the beachy head lighthouse because the room is a little bit in that so here we are come into the finish and start line of the beach he had Martin which is kind of just about here when you do the South Downs way 100 or the 50 you get to this trig point here you take a left and you go down to Eastbourne Sports Park where you finished the race that we have come along the other section of the briber way to South Downs Road drive away so we started the foot of beachy head followed the driver way and now we're gonna head all the way to Worthing to Hill barn in Worthing to the start of the South Downs way 50 so essentially we're now running the South Downs way 50 in Reverse as well as finishing off the beachy head marathon and starting the 3/4 marathon [Music] well known to any South Downs Way runner any beachy head marathon runner this is the famous white bridge at South Austin [Music] okay so Victoria has done her Centurion running one community marathon beachy head marathon from Bo Peep carpark all the way around so now I'm gonna carry on along the South Downs way and get myself to worthy given that this was a Centurion organised event it seemed appropriate to be running on such a well-known and well-loved Centurion course [Applause] [Music] feel really sick but I always do around 35 miles and it often lasts until 60 miles when I usually throw up [Music] so the plan with this Centurion ruling one community event is to run 100 miles and we've already done Victoria and I did the beach he had Marathon this morning so that was sick 26 miles so then I plan to run to Devil's Dyke and from there we start the three faults marathon so I'll run the 3/4 marathon I'm gonna do all of the stunning stinger marathon and then I'm gonna run back out to Devil's dike just to finish off the three faults apparently and hopefully by mid-morning tomorrow morning we'll have done and over a hundred miles if that makes any sense I hope it does because it doesn't make anything me and as I ran I could sense four thousand other runners across the world overcoming their own challenges right beside me [Music] it's the most beautiful day they're absolutely stunning 22 6:00 in the evening and our next port of call is ditching beacon which is just about half a kilometer further on [Music] right okay I've had food and some drink I've thrown up everywhere which has been great 78 kilometers in so almost halfway and we're off next who shanked and breathe so right from here all the way to checked and breathe and then all the way down rounds history down to kill Barnes where I'm gonna be Victoria again having completed the beachy head marathon and two thirds of the South Downs way 50 part of me felt like calling it a day right there but with a big push from my wife I headed into the night to start the three-fourths challenge so named because it links the three ancient hill forts of Devil's dike sanctum Bree and sis pre ring so I've done 104 kilometers well just over 104 kilometers it's now what time is it about 10 past midnight and I'm at Hill barn so I've now and officially finished the South Downs way 50 in Reverse and I've finished the first half of the 3/4 marathon so I'm now going to start the second half of the three ports marathon but I'm not gonna do all of that because halfway through that I'm gonna break off and do the whole of the Stenning stinger marathon and then I'm going to finish off the 3/4 marathon by running out back to Devil's dike ok so I'm standing in the middle of the road but it is half us two in the morning so I've just come to the start location start/finish area for the spinning stinger marathon so that behind me there is a stunning leisure center this is the start finish of the staining stingers so now just heading back out and going out to follow the loop around and come back it's 2:30 6:00 in the morning I've done 100 and 16.7 km/h 8 minutes let's get going and get round this spinning loop it's quarter past 4:00 in the morning I've done a hundred and twenty five kilometres this is the top of was almost the top of one of the major climbs of the Stelling stinger marathon and what an amazing view of the the early morning sunrise very early morning sunrise so if you look at the map of the stunning stinger route the whole route kind of looks like a an old man stooped over with a very large pointy nose and the point of that nose is here so this is where we turn around and follow this path and now we're on our way back this is the farthest eight point we get we're on our way back towards sanctum Bree and sis Bree making it through the night always feels good I had been struggling but sunrise gave me new strength in my legs and the knowledge that the finish was within reach Stenning stinger 3/4 and beachy head are all significant challenges in their own right linking them together had seemed like a perfect plan but the reality of these things is often far less glamorous everything hurt by now but it's supposed to that's why we do it that's why we love it bye 18 minutes past seven hundred and forty-three kilometres done I am now offered to finish the last little bit of spelling stinger and then we're on our way to Devil's dike to finish three thoughts Marisa [Music] and here we are back at the crossroads again so we've done the beachy head now at the time we've done the South Downs way 50 in Reverse we've done the Stelling sting America all that's left to do is the final section let's head back up to Devil's Dyke 151 km/h 05.05.2014 [Music] and it doesn't matter who you are Martin and you made it through [Music] collective journey we did it together community [Music] hundred sixty three kilometers it's 28 hours and three minutes [Music] so that is it the Centurion running one community bed is over for me anyway 100 miles done we'll leave you here on the beautiful gorgeous Devil's Dyke thanks very much for watching take care we'll see for another film I run dosing [Music] spaces these changes mean after friends and family can start to meet their loved ones

[00:06] if your friend
[00:19] in 2020 across the world friends and
[00:22] families were torn apart communities
[00:25] they're fractured by an invisible enemy
[00:29] but this is a story about coming
[00:31] together about an adventure designed to
[00:34] beat the separation and loneliness one
[00:37] community no longer bound by convention
[00:39] but by a shared passion set out on a
[00:43] journey and together
[00:44] during the global lockdown they were set
[00:47] free
[00:49] [Music]
[00:55] welcome to film my run for the Centurion
[00:59] running one community event or croc and
[01:04] it's known and Victoria's running the
[01:09] beachy head marathon today and that's
[01:13] just a start my adventure hopefully I
[01:15] can run a little bit further beautiful
[01:19] day on the South Bend we started the
[01:21] beachhead marathon it's a Bo Peep car
[01:24] park which is kind of half way around
[01:25] and then we're kind of do the whole loop
[01:28] and come back
[01:32] Centurions one community event attracted
[01:35] some 4,000 runners and walkers from all
[01:38] over the world distances from 5k to 100
[01:42] miles could be completed over a week
[01:44] either at home on a treadmill or
[01:46] outdoors on road or trail
[01:51] we're heading down into the village of
[01:53] Lillington and then we are going to be
[01:56] going all the way through this wooded
[01:59] area here to West Dean and then through
[02:02] 2xe act and then up the hills over there
[02:04] where you see is the start climbing the
[02:07] Seven Sisters the village is actually
[02:13] called littling ttan and that wooded
[02:15] area I mentioned is Freeston forest it's
[02:19] also debatable whether it's pronounced
[02:21] XE at or exit regardless the cook Muir
[02:25] Valley is stunning and we continued to
[02:28] run on to the Seven Sisters Hills and
[02:31] headed towards the Bell to lighthouse
[02:33] before reaching beachy head itself
[02:37] [Music]
[03:05] you don't actually see on the beach
[03:08] ahead marathon is the beachy head
[03:10] lighthouse because the room is a little
[03:12] bit in that
[03:18] so here we are come into the finish and
[03:22] start line of the beach he had Martin
[03:24] which is kind of just about here
[03:31] when you do the South Downs way 100 or
[03:35] the 50 you get to this trig point here
[03:38] you take a left and you go down to
[03:40] Eastbourne Sports Park where you
[03:42] finished the race that we have come
[03:44] along the other section of the briber
[03:47] way to South Downs Road drive away so we
[03:49] started the foot of beachy head followed
[03:51] the driver way and now we're gonna head
[03:53] all the way to Worthing to Hill barn in
[03:57] Worthing to the start of the South Downs
[03:58] way 50 so essentially we're now running
[04:01] the South Downs way 50 in Reverse as
[04:05] well as finishing off the beachy head
[04:07] marathon and starting the 3/4 marathon
[04:16] [Music]
[04:22] well known to any South Downs Way runner
[04:25] any beachy head marathon runner this is
[04:28] the famous white bridge at South Austin
[04:34] [Music]
[04:36] okay so Victoria has done her Centurion
[04:40] running one community marathon beachy
[04:43] head marathon from Bo Peep carpark all
[04:45] the way around so now I'm gonna carry on
[04:47] along the South Downs way and get myself
[04:51] to worthy given that this was a
[04:54] Centurion organised event it seemed
[04:56] appropriate to be running on such a
[04:58] well-known and well-loved Centurion
[05:01] course
[05:02] [Applause]
[05:04] [Music]
[05:06] feel really sick but I always do around
[05:10] 35 miles and it often lasts until 60
[05:16] miles when I usually throw up
[05:22] [Music]
[05:36] so the plan with this Centurion ruling
[05:39] one community event is to run 100 miles
[05:44] and we've already done Victoria and I
[05:46] did the beach he had Marathon this
[05:48] morning so that was sick 26 miles so
[05:51] then I plan to run to Devil's Dyke and
[05:53] from there we start the three faults
[05:57] marathon so I'll run the 3/4 marathon
[06:01] I'm gonna do all of the stunning stinger
[06:04] marathon and then I'm gonna run back out
[06:06] to Devil's dike just to finish off the
[06:09] three faults apparently and hopefully by
[06:13] mid-morning tomorrow morning we'll have
[06:15] done and over a hundred miles if that
[06:19] makes any sense I hope it does because
[06:21] it doesn't make anything me and as I ran
[06:25] I could sense four thousand other
[06:27] runners across the world overcoming
[06:30] their own challenges right beside me
[06:35] [Music]
[06:40] it's the most beautiful day they're
[06:44] absolutely stunning 22 6:00 in the
[06:47] evening and our next port of call is
[06:51] ditching beacon which is just about half
[06:54] a kilometer further on
[06:58] [Music]
[07:12] right okay I've had food and some drink
[07:17] I've thrown up everywhere which has been
[07:18] great 78 kilometers in so almost halfway
[07:22] and we're off next who shanked and
[07:26] breathe so right from here all the way
[07:28] to checked and breathe and then all the
[07:29] way down rounds history down to kill
[07:32] Barnes where I'm gonna be Victoria again
[07:35] having completed the beachy head
[07:38] marathon and two thirds of the South
[07:40] Downs way 50 part of me felt like
[07:43] calling it a day right there but with a
[07:46] big push from my wife I headed into the
[07:49] night to start the three-fourths
[07:51] challenge so named because it links the
[07:54] three ancient hill forts of Devil's dike
[07:57] sanctum Bree and sis pre ring so I've
[08:02] done 104 kilometers well just over 104
[08:07] kilometers it's now what time is it
[08:10] about 10 past midnight and I'm at Hill
[08:13] barn so I've now and officially finished
[08:17] the South Downs way 50 in Reverse and
[08:21] I've finished the first half of the 3/4
[08:26] marathon so I'm now going to start the
[08:29] second half of the three ports marathon
[08:31] but I'm not gonna do all of that because
[08:34] halfway through that I'm gonna break off
[08:37] and do the whole of the Stenning stinger
[08:40] marathon and then I'm going to finish
[08:42] off the 3/4 marathon by running out back
[08:47] to Devil's dike ok so I'm standing in
[08:52] the middle of the road but it is half us
[08:54] two in the morning so I've just come to
[08:57] the start location start/finish area for
[09:01] the spinning stinger marathon so that
[09:05] behind me there is a stunning leisure
[09:08] center this is the start finish of the
[09:11] staining stingers so now just heading
[09:13] back out and going out to follow the
[09:16] loop around and come back
[09:21] it's 2:30 6:00 in the morning I've done
[09:24] 100 and
[09:26] 16.7 km/h 8 minutes let's get going and
[09:31] get round this spinning loop it's
[09:37] quarter past 4:00 in the morning
[09:40] I've done a hundred and twenty five
[09:43] kilometres this is the top of was almost
[09:47] the top of one of the major climbs of
[09:50] the Stelling stinger marathon and what
[09:54] an amazing view of the the early morning
[09:58] sunrise very early morning sunrise so if
[10:06] you look at the map of the stunning
[10:08] stinger route the whole route kind of
[10:12] looks like a an old man stooped over
[10:15] with a very large pointy nose and the
[10:19] point of that nose
[10:22] is here so this is where we turn around
[10:26] and follow this path and now we're on
[10:31] our way back this is the farthest eight
[10:34] point we get we're on our way back
[10:37] towards sanctum Bree and sis Bree making
[10:43] it through the night always feels good I
[10:46] had been struggling but sunrise gave me
[10:49] new strength in my legs and the
[10:51] knowledge that the finish was within
[10:53] reach Stenning stinger 3/4 and beachy
[10:57] head are all significant challenges in
[11:00] their own right
[11:01] linking them together had seemed like a
[11:03] perfect plan but the reality of these
[11:06] things is often far less glamorous
[11:09] everything hurt by now but it's supposed
[11:12] to that's why we do it that's why we
[11:15] love it
[11:16] bye 18 minutes past seven hundred and
[11:19] forty-three kilometres done I am now
[11:21] offered to finish the last little bit of
[11:23] spelling stinger and then we're on our
[11:25] way to Devil's dike to finish three
[11:27] thoughts Marisa
[11:34] [Music]
[11:42] and here we are back at the crossroads
[11:44] again so we've done the beachy head now
[11:46] at the time we've done the South Downs
