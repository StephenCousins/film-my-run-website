==================================================

[00:00] This is Dorking. What county is Dorking in?  Surrey, I think. West Sussex? Is it still West  
[00:07] Sussex? Who knows? Who really cares? We’re  here to do the Hurtwood 50K. My friend Tom  
[00:17] Sutton organises this with Freedom Racing. It’s  a little over 50 kilometres, something like 52,  
[00:24] and we’ll be heading out and back. So it’s  a lollipop shape. We go out, we go around  
[00:29] a little loop, and then we come back, and that’s  our 50k. Starting and finishing here in Dorking,  
[00:51] Tom’s first ultra from the running channel. How  are you feeling? Pretty nervous, but you know,  
[00:56] I’ve done the training so I deserve to be here, I  reckon. So let’s go. Absolutely. Just go out and  
[01:01] enjoy it. Yeah, good stuff. All right. You haven’t  got a time in mind, have you? No. Good. Well,  
[01:06] before the cut-off. There you go. Well, good  luck to Tom and, you know, Sarah. You know,  
[01:13] I spent 24 hours in a van with Sarah in the  summer. Good luck to you. Thank you. So one  
[01:19] of the interesting things about this race is that  we are a dibber race. That means you don’t have a  
[01:24] chip on your number or on your shoe. That’s the  other thing. It’s a rolling start. So there is a  
[01:29] mass start at 9:30, but it’s 8:30 now, so I’m not  going to stand around here for an hour. We may as  
[01:34] well just get going. Thank you very much. Right,  we’re off. Thanks a lot, Tom. See you later. Okay,  
[01:41] away we go on the Hurtwood 50k. I don’t know where  we’re going, so we just start out walking. Right,  
[01:48] I think it’s just straight up this  street. It’s not cold this morning.  
[01:53] I thought it would be freezing, and I did put my  jumper on initially, but I don’t need it on. I’ve  
[01:57] got my waterproof and my vest. That’ll do. So,  50k in the woods, but we’ve got to get out of  
[02:02] Dorking first. I think I’ve already gone wrong.  Hilarious. Yeah, that was a good start. Already  
[02:13] went wrong about 20 metres too far. Missed the  turning left. So we’re already leaving the road  
[02:25] less than a kilometre in. I’ve known about  the Hurtwood 50k race for a long time, and  
[02:34] I always assumed it was called Hurtwood because  the race route is predominantly through the woods,  
[02:39] and because of the terrain and elevation, it  hurts. Clever — but no. Hurtwood is actually  
[02:46] the name given to 2,000 acres of common land in  Surrey. The word “hurt” either comes from the  
[02:52] hurt berries, which grow wild in and around the  wooded areas, or from the Old English word chert,  
[02:59] meaning a rough common overgrown with gorse,  broom and bracken. So now you know. How lovely  
[03:06] is that? That’s a fantastic waterfall. I started  the race very conservatively, both in terms of my  
[03:14] pace and my attire, fully covered as I was in my  waterproof and beanie. However, I soon realised  
[03:21] it was far too warm, and by 5k in I’d unzipped my  jacket and taken my hat off. Particularly muddy  
[03:30] little section. This is glorious. Through  the woods here it is pouring with rain,  
[03:35] but it’s not cold, so I don’t really want to wear  my waterproof and stuff. We’re 10k in. We’ve just  
[03:42] hit 10k — 1 hour 17 minutes — so we’re going all  right. But one major catastrophe last night. I  
[03:54] packed everything and then slept in the van. Got  up this morning, packed my kit into my race vest.  
[04:04] What’s the one thing I forgot to put in my race  vest — and I’ve never forgotten this before? I’ve  
[04:10] completely forgotten to put my water bottles  into my vest. I have a cup, but technically  
[04:18] I’ve failed mandatory kit. I don’t know whether  I’ll get a penalty for that because I’ll have  
[04:23] to let them know at the first checkpoint that  that’s what’s happened. I’ll be fine, but it’s  
[04:32] a little bit annoying. Never done that before.  We are climbing to the highest point in the run,  
[04:43] which is early on in the race, at the top of  Leith Hill. That’s what we’re doing at the moment.  
[05:05] Thank you, buddy. First aid station at 12k in.  Right, I’ve made a rookie mandatory kit error.  
[05:15] I brought all my kit with me, put it in my van.  What have I forgotten to put in my race vest?  
[05:22] I’ve got my cup, but I haven’t got any bottles.  I don’t know if that means I’ve failed mandatory  
[05:29] kit and I have to have, like, a time penalty — not  a DQ. Don’t DQ me. I’m fine for water. It’s just,  
[05:38] if it’s an official thing that I failed on,  let’s talk and get on with it, yeah? Hello,  
[05:46] Piggot. I’m fine for fluids in terms of drinking.  It’s just, you know, I don’t want to get DQ’d. Can  
[05:52] I get a picture of him, please? Yeah, of course  you can. Have you seen Sarah? Okay, somebody has  
[05:58] very kindly — somebody called John — thank you.  John has very kindly given me a water bottle to  
[06:04] carry with me. I haven’t filled it up because I  don’t need anything just yet. I’ve got some Coke,  
[06:07] and we’re on our way down the other side of  Leith Hill now. Steep steps. Fifteen kilometres  
[06:19] in exactly 1 hour 54 minutes. Doing all right.  Pouring with rain, but still not cold enough  
[06:30] to keep my jacket on or anything like that. I may  regret this later on because I’ll be wet and cold  
[06:43] and perhaps slowing down, but at the moment we’re  cracking on. We made it to the top of Leith Hill,  
[06:53] came down, hit the checkpoint, and now we’re going  back up again. I made it to the top of Holmbury  
[07:00] Hill at just under 18 km in 2 hours 18 minutes.  Unfortunately, there was no view from the top,  
[07:08] so it was quickly on to another very muddy,  slippy descent before our next climb.  
[07:15] Very, very slippy descent. Went over once. Don’t  want to grab these barbed wire fences because  
[07:22] that’s going to rip your hand open, so you have to  be very careful. How the fast guys come down here,  
[07:27] I don’t know. Laura, how many 50ks have you done  before this one? Good question. Six or seven. So  
[07:36] you’re pretty experienced, know what you’re doing.  What’s your plan for today? Survive. It’s a bit  
[07:43] wet, isn’t it? It is a bit wet, yeah. Just trying  to stay upright. Yeah. Oh, I’ve been down already.  
[07:51] The white trig point, with added high-vis marshal,  marks the summit of Pitch Hill, the third-highest  
[07:58] summit in the race, with spectacular views across  the Hurtwood Estate. Just not today. Well done,  
[08:06] buddy. Right, we’ve done 20k — well over 20k now  — and we have 20 miles to go. We can’t be far off  
[08:19] the loop now because I’ve got runners coming  back this way already. They could have started  
[08:25] at 8 o’clock, which would be half an hour before  me, but I’ve already had three or four runners  
[08:32] coming back this way. Two hours 40 minutes —  nearly 21k in. Right, checkpoint at the loop.  
[08:57] Away we go on our loop. This is a five-mile loop.  Sorry, I’ve got Marmite sandwiches in my mouth.  
[09:05] I’ve got Coke and Marmite sandwiches. So yeah,  we’re 22k in. An 8k loop brings us back at 30k,  
[09:20] and the whole run is 52k, so that’s another 22k.  That works out absolutely correctly. Why I would  
[09:28] question it, I don’t know. I had begun running  an hour ahead of the mass start, and by now the  
[09:34] fast runners were overtaking me. Given the terrain  and underfoot conditions, it’s impressive to note  
[09:40] that some of these guys would complete the course  over three hours quicker than me. The thing is,  
[09:46] apart from not being as young and fit, I’m  just far too tentative on the descents,  
[09:52] frightened about slipping, falling and breaking my  leg — or disfiguring my chiselled face on a rock.  
[09:59] Hi, mate. Well done, guys. Looking  speedy. Right, 3 hours 21 minutes in,  
[10:07] we’ve just passed halfway. So if I keep  this up, that’s what — 6 hours 40? I’d  
[10:14] be happy with anything under seven hours at  this rate. Three hours 21 for halfway. Very  
[10:21] happy with that. I was hoping for anywhere  between six and seven hours, so that’s fine.  
[10:29] Still traversing the loop, and just south of  Farley Green we ran along this amazing ancient  
[10:35] sunken pathway that looks like an old railway  line, but has just been carved out of the rock  
[10:41] over centuries of use. Right, we’re back at the  end of the loop. So 22 km to go. We’ve done 30k,  
[10:56] and we’ve just got to remember to dib in. Always  remember to dib in with your dibber. Oh, and throw  
[11:05] my cup away. Why not? Beautiful. Thank you. Well  done, guys. Great work. Good job. So we’re still  
[11:17] on for under seven hours at the moment. Just hope  the legs don’t give way in the last 10k. I’ve  
[11:24] got another Marmite sandwich, I’ve had some Coke,  and I’ve got some water. So with just over a half  
[11:29] marathon to go, thank you very much for watching.  If you haven’t subscribed to the channel, please  
[11:33] do that now, and do watch to the very end to see  how we get on and whether we can get in under  
[11:41] seven hours. If we can, we’d really appreciate  your support. Back at the top of Pitch Hill,  
[11:50] the high-vis marshal had obviously given up and  gone for a cup of tea, and I don’t blame him  
[11:55] one bit. The wind had now increased and the rain  was lashing down harder than ever. I was, however,  
[12:02] determined to keep the positive split as small as  possible. Twenty miles done, just under 20 to go,  
[12:11] in 4 hours 14 minutes. There’s just no let-up with  the wind and rain. It has started to get a bit  
[12:19] windier now as well, so we’re battling rain and  then quite a blowy wind. But we are definitely on  
[12:28] the homeward stretch. Speedier runners were still  flying past me as we approached the checkpoint. On  
[12:35] the climb back up to Leith Hill, I took a Protein  Rebel gel because I was starting to feel rather  
[12:41] drained of energy by now. Link in the description  for a discount on Protein Rebel gels and  
[12:47] supplements, by the way. Dibbing in for the last  time. Final checkpoint, kissing. Okay, we’re on  
[12:59] the final climb back up to the top of Leith Hill.  I’ve got some Coke, I’ve got peanuts in my mouth,  
[13:08] and we have 12k to go. Quite tired now, and  because I’ve slowed down I am getting a little  
[13:15] bit cold. But hopefully once we get to the top  of Leith Hill we can start running again and warm  
[13:22] up. I am worried I’m not going to make it under  seven hours, but we’ll just do the best we can.  
[13:30] I was really hoping the Protein Rebel gel, the  Coke and the food I’d had at the last stop would  
[13:36] kick in soon because I’d definitely slowed, and  if things didn’t pick up I wouldn’t even make my C  
[13:42] goal of seven hours. I got back up to the highest  point of the race — the impressive tower on the  
[13:48] top of Leith Hill — with the rain making filming  almost impossible, and thought, well, it’s now  
[13:55] or never. And I started to run. Thankfully, the  descent off Leith Hill is fairly runnable, and I  
[14:02] started to claw back a few minutes here and there.  Less than 5k to go. This is going to be so tight  
[14:08] now. Forty minutes, so I need to do 8 minutes per  kilometre in order to finish under seven hours.  
[14:17] Can I do it? I’m going to try. I am going to try.  Looking at the shot of my leg turnover, what I  
[14:25] thought was a super-fast final 5k looks like a  weary trudge through the mud. Still, I pushed  
[14:32] on with the time ticking ever closer to seven  hours. I was still in the woods with less than a  
[14:38] kilometre to go. Despite having the GPX file on my  watch telling me exactly how far I had left, the  
[14:46] finish still seemed so far away. But eventually  I made it to the road. Nearly there now.  
[15:23] Thank you so much. Okay. 6:57. So just  made it under. Just made it under seven.  
[15:53] Good job. The winner did it in 3 hours 43  minutes, broke the record by 58 seconds  
[16:08] apparently. Wow. Hugh Tibbs was running.  Hugh came second in 3:57. So well done,  
[16:16] Hugh. Let’s see the official time now. 6:57:51.  Thank goodness. Just in under seven hours.
