[00:43] six hours basically just just run up and

[01:54] director and organizer of a 10 you are a
[01:57] number of ridiculous themed runs tell me

[02:03] the kind of heat ethos behind it Phoenix
[02:05] only really came out of me personally
[02:08] running loads and loads of mountains
[02:09] around the country particularly back in
[02:11] 2013 when I did a load of them and you
[02:16] know I guess we sort of thought from
[02:18] having done lots of event that I figured
[02:19] we can put on some pretty good events we
[02:21] figured we knew what people wanted you
[02:24] know small low-key lots of fun not too
[02:28] serious
[02:28] massive medals which is pretty much
[02:32] where we focus our attention it is true
