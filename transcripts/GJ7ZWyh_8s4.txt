==================================================

[00:00] Manchester has had a marathon since 2012. It's the second largest in the U K, with around
[00:06] 30,000 runners starting and finishing near the Old Trafford football ground. This is
[00:12] the other Old Trafford.
[00:14] Old Trafford. Cricket ground. I was born in Manchester some 21 years ago.
[00:19] You sure about that? I'd booked the marathon as a fallback in case my A race in Paris was
[00:24] canceled. My bag is in bag drop.
[00:26] So we just need to find our way to the start now. Despite what I'm about to say about just
[00:33] having fun, I had a plan for Manchester.
[00:37] Given that my Paris experience had felt relatively comfortable and I had run quite conservatively
[00:42] in the first half, I thought I would try and run the first 13 miles of Manchester as hard
[00:48] as I could. The plan was to basically run at my half marathon pace and try to hold on
[00:54] as long as possible. Right, we did the job in Paris, so today is all about having fun
[00:59] and enjoying ourselves.
[01:01] This is the Manchester Marathon. It's the first time I've ever done the Manchester Marathon,
[01:05] so I'm going to really enjoy it and just have a lot of fun. Okay, here we go, then.
[01:11] Manchester Marathon. Good luck, guys. Just passing the start now.
[01:22] I started running at just over four minutes per kilometre. Completing the full marathon
[01:27] at this pace would mean a finish time of around 2 hours, 50 minutes.
[01:32] Lots of people so I don't know how crowded it's going to be. The first couple of kilometres
[01:39] was very congested and there was quite a bit of dodging and weaving to find some space.
[01:44] Right, I am definitely not feeling as comfortable as I did in Paris, but I am going a bit quicker.
[01:52] So that was just over 20 minutes for five k. Let's just see how long we can keep this
[01:59] pace up. But, yeah, I'm definitely not feeling as comfortable as I was two weeks ago.
[02:04] As always, I knew plenty of other people running the marathon and it was great to see people
[02:09] I knew out on the course supporting as well. That's Paul and Amy. Okay, that's ten k in
[02:21] just over 40 minutes.
[02:22] So still managing to keep up what is stupid pace for me. Really shouldn't be going this
[02:28] quick, but let's just see how long we can keep it up. Of course, I'd not trained to
[02:35] run at this pace at all and I knew I'd have residual fatigue in my legs from the Paris
[02:40] Marathon, but I was determined to blindly ignore all the obvious red flags and just
[02:45] keep going.
[02:47] 15k in. Still doing okay. Ask me again at halfway.
[02:56] Another factor to add to my list of excuses for what's about to happen is that partly
[03:01] due to lack of planning and partly down to my own stubbornness, I decided to run the
[03:06] entire race without any nutrition at all. Regular viewers will be aware of my hatred
[03:12] of gels. But that doesn't mean I don't think you need at least some carbs during a race
[03:17] to keep you afloat.
[03:19] In Paris I'd had half a banana and some fizzy drink around 17 miles. Today, I wouldn't have
[03:25] anything. Okay, that's halfway in 1 hour 25 minutes 30 seconds.
[03:31] I am tired, definitely tired. So we'll just see if we can hang on as much as possible.
[03:38] Twenty one k to go.
[03:41] See what we can do. I was also discovering that the organisers claim that Manchester
[03:47] is the flattest marathon in the UK is a complete fallacy. There are regular inclines, for example,
[03:54] like the bridges over the canal at Timperley and approaching Altrincham over the Timperley
[03:59] Brook.
[04:00] Not to mention the steep climb into Altrincham. 25K in 1:41 and a half. About an hour and
[04:07] 18 minutes to do the last 17K should be okay, but I'm definitely tired. Definitely tired.
[04:15] Running through towns like Charlton, Sale and Altrincham certainly provided more in
[04:19] the way of crowd support, but there were definitely sections of motorway and suburbia which were
[04:25] pretty quiet. 30 km in 2 hours and 1 minute. If we want to get under three, we’ve got
[04:34] 58 minutes to do twelve k. We can do that. But it's whether we want to push for a horrible,
[04:42] painful last twelve k and try and beat my PB.
[04:49] Last twelve k. Here we go. 2 hours and ten minutes.
[04:58] Ten k to go. Thank you, buddy. Cheers.
[05:09] Given the less than ideal circumstances leading into my Manchester marathon and the pace at
[05:14] which I set out, the pain I'm feeling here is entirely of my own making and was completely
[05:20] predictable. 35k in 2 hours, 23 minutes. Seven k to go.
[05:27] Just over seven k. Really hurting now though. I am slowing down drastically, but we're still
[05:33] on for under three at least.
[05:36] I'm trying, buddy. Thank you. 2 hours 32 with five k to go.
[05:43] I'm so tired now. It really hurting. Grinding out the last five k was as tortuous as it
[05:51] looks.
[05:52] And this is exactly what it looks like for every runner who goes out too hard and beyond
[05:56] their capability in a marathon. When you're in it, the only thing you want is for it to
[06:02] end. And although this was to some degree a self enforced experiment, I still went in
[06:08] at the beginning hoping and believing I had a chance of pulling it off.
[06:13] And despite knowing deep down that I probably would crash and burn, it's still humbling
[06:18] and demoralising when it happens. There is no worse way to run a race than a positive
[06:25] split where you go hard in the first half and die in the second. It's just horrible.
[06:30] You should never, never, ever run a marathon like that. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[06:45] Well, that was hard earned today. Went out really hard. I knew.
[06:53] I mean, I knew I'd gone out really hard. I deliberately went out as hard as I could possibly
[06:58] imagine going. And my plan was to get to halfway and see if I could hold on.
[07:04] And I couldn't hold on. Sub three. I'm happy with sub three again. 2:57. Ideally, I would
[07:13] have beaten my PB if I'd held on a bit stronger, but I mean, you'll see on my Strava graph,
[07:20] I just died after 30K. Slower and slower and slower.
[07:25] And it's an awful way to run because in that last ten k, you're getting passed by so many
[07:30] people, it's demoralising. You're so fatigued and tired, you just want to slow down and
[07:37] slow down and slow down. Whereas the way I ran Paris so much more enjoyable because you
[07:44] feel strong at the end, you're passing runners at the end and you get a faster time.
[07:50] Maybe I did go out way too hard. Maybe there was a happy medium between normal marathon
[07:56] pace and kamikaze pace, but I managed to kamikaze pace for around 25, then just couldn't hold
[08:06] on. Having gone out at 2 hours, 50 minutes pace, I finished in 2 hours, 57 minutes.
[08:13] Still my second fastest marathon, but one of the least satisfying in terms of its execution.
[08:21] Luke well done, what did you get today? 2:51. Luke passed me with about a mile to go.
[08:29] He shouted, Come on. And I just couldn't drag anything else out of myself. Well done.
[08:36] That's all right. How have you done? 3 hours and 34 seconds? Oh, no, mate!
[08:47] I tried. And look, we're in the same shoes. They're good, aren't they? They're brilliant.
[08:53] Really nice. It was really great to meet so many of you in Manchester who watch the videos
[08:58] and support the Channel. Thank you for coming and saying hello.
[09:01] And particularly to those of you who tried to spur me on as you passed me in those final
[09:06] miles, it was truly appreciated. And if you ever do see me in a race, please do come and
[09:12] say hello. Well, that was a hard fought sub 3 hours today.
[09:18] Crashed and burned in the last ten k. Although obviously I did go out very hard. I've been
[09:26] feeling really bad since I finished.
[09:28] Really horrible. Stomach cramps and yeah, just awful. I don't get that very often.
[09:35] And I had some water about two k before the end because I was feeling terrible, but it
[09:41] made me feel even worse. And then since finishing, I've just been sat down, trying to recover.
[09:48] Feeling like being sick, but not being sick.
[09:52] If you've done a marathon and you've suffered in the last ten k, you know the feeling. So
[09:56] I've been standing at the finish line, waiting for somebody that we know to finish. Hello.
[10:05] Been standing at the finish line, waiting for somebody that we know to finish and they
[10:09] haven't finished. I couldn't see them anywhere, so we've given up and with a pair of scissors
[10:18] on his back. So I'm making my way now back to the tram so I can get back to the car.
[10:26] Matt? Well done Matt. You know the guy I said I was just trying to see? I've just seen him.
