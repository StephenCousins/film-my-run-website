TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

Welcome to film my run. This is CCC. There is a place, a mystical, magical place
known only to ultra runners. A Mecca, if you will. Welcome to Shamani in France, home of the
Utmb Ultra running festival one. As an ultra runner with a young family, it
becomes the case that every holiday has a race attached to it. And, ergo, every race becomes a family holiday. We spent the early part of our week in Shamani,
riding the cable car, hiking up the side of Mont Blanc, riding on the lough. Yeah. Wow. And then the two children, who regularly resist
our attempts to get them up for park run on a Saturday morning, decided they wanted to
run 5 km, an 800 meters descent from a glacier all the way down to the town at the bottom
of the hill. Like, yeah, let's go have a look. For one week in August, the greatest ultra
runners in the world convene in Shamani to run races from 15 km up to 300 km. Circumnavigating. The highest mountain in Western Europe. Montblanc the flagship event is the Utmb,
the ultra trail de Mont Blanc, a 100 miles race. From Chamoni round Montblanc and back to Chamoni,
they both decided to run down the mountain. That's incredible. Whilst visiting the Running Expo, my children
were fortunate enough to meet and interview one of the race favorites, Jim Warmsley. How far do you run in your races? But you also do park run? 5 km. Wow. And we spent the evening watching an amazing
finish to the 120 kilometer TDs race. As it was to be my first Utmb experience,
I'd opted for the slightly shorter 100 kilometer race called CCC. It has 6000 meters of elevation, 122,000 meters
of vertical, an absolutely excruciating race. Weather conditions were not easy out there
today, but these men, they're in order to get your race bid for CCC, you need to arrive
at a certain time slot. So I've arrived between twelve and two, and
here I am in a huge queue of runners, and they just go along, saying, anyone who isn't
a runner, please don't join this queue. Part of what makes the Utmb so unique is its
system of entry. You can't just rock up on the day, pay your
money and run. You can't even go to the website and sign
up. You have to qualify. To qualify, you have to take part in a series
of races over a number of years. Each race gains you points. The harder the race, the more points you gain. However, even when you've got enough points,
that doesn't guarantee you entry to the race. You have to enter a ballot, and it could take
three years before your name is drawn out of the hat. Thank you very much. Success. Oh, and by the way, unless you've done it,
you have absolutely no idea how terrifying pre race mandatory kit check and number collection
can be. Honestly, have I remembered everything? Two head torches taped seams on my coat. Have I got my ID? Did I remember to pack that extra layer? What if my gloves aren't waterproof? Will I be disqualified before I even get to
the start line? Honestly, it's terrifying. It's 06:20 in the morning, so we're in the
queue at Plaster Monblanc to get the bus through the tunnel to call My Air. And we start at 09:00 A.m.. So I've got my porridge, I've got some coffee
to drink and we're all good. We're all good. It's a nervous time early in the morning on
the bus to a race. There's nothing to do but contemplate what
the day might hold. Cormaya time seems to stand still. The slow walk to the start line. Okay, so these red trolleys here that you
can see are there specifically to take the green CCC bag back to Chamoni for you to collect
at the end. Hey, guys, time is welcome to film my run. My name's Steve Cousins. Here we are in corn my air. This is in Italy. We're about to run 100 km over 100 km. About 6000 meters of ascent all the way. Well, halfway around all over the world here. We've got two minutes to go to Start CCC 2018. The atmosphere at the start is really incredible. They really ramp it up. And we started as though we were running a
ten k race. To be honest, looking at the footage, it does
look like the first few hundred meters is actually downhill. Although I completely forgot about that when
we started climbing. Cormayere is lovely. It's like the opposite version of Chamoni
on the Italian side of Montblanc, and it comes at around about 70 km into the full 100 miles
utmb race. So literally ten minutes into the race and
we started climbing from the very beginning. Loads of people are still running. My guess is they're all full of adrenaline. Not really thinking about how that's going
to tie them out at 90 km into the race. So I've swallowed my pride. Walking USA representing here. We're here. Loving the shirt and the hat. What's going on with that, then? Hey, you know, number one, it keeps the sun
off my face, so there's a positive there. Number two, my wife finds me at every aid
station, and I'm never going to argue with that. That is absolutely true. We know that very well. A sea of orange or blue or whatever. Shirt, neon spandex. That's the key here. Avoid that and you're good. Check shirt. Hi. 450 meters climbed and it's been climbing
all the way since the start. We've covered just over 2 miles. Two and a half miles in 42 minutes. Okay, so the reports are that it's going to
be cloudy today and quite foggy tonight. So take in the views while you can because
there's not going to be many of them later on. But this is what we came for. So just over five k in 51 minutes so far. And yourself? Yeah, not too bad. Wait for the rain. Yeah. And this got a fog. Yeah, we enjoyed the rain. We done this before? No, no, first time. So it is it's on the OCC two years ago. Okay. The shorter version. So you got a bit of experience of it. Yeah. That is 1300 meters climbed. That hill has just killed me. You know, we're only ten k in 2 hours, four
minutes gone and absolutely shattered. Climbing that just now. And we still got all that to go up there. You can see the climb is going up there. Okay. Top of the first climb, ten point 66 km running,
2 hours 17 minutes, and we've climbed 1434 meters. I think it's good to have goals and to set
yourself targets in a race. Before I started, I thought that 20 hours
was a realistic target for CCC. However, two and a quarter hours in and I
was already beginning to question whether I'd complete the course at all. So in the early stages of a trail race, especially
one that's 100K or 100 miles, when you've got descents that are steep like this, you
cannot go busting your quads out because you will be ruined for the rest of the race. So, depending on your level of fitness and
your level of experience, just watch yourself down these first inclines that you don't go
overly fast and ruin yourself for the second half. Just come into the first aid session. 15 km in 2 hours, 52 minutes. Agua. So this is the first checkpoint, refuge, baton,
aqua, water, nephew. Awesome, Gabrielle. Thank you, Gabrielle. Good work. Thank you, buddy. I think it's a given that in any ultra race
you're going to have a few low moments. But to have my first wobble so early was really
worrying. Thank you. One thing that did keep my spirits up, though,
was the amazing scenery. I've run in some great places, but this was
incredible. Okay, we are 20 km in just over 20 km in 3
hours 44 minutes and I'm suffering a crisis of confidence. I didn't account for how steep and long that
first climb was. I think I probably went off too quickly. There's a lot of pressure because it's single
track a lot of the way up, so you've got pressure from people behind to keep going faster than
perhaps you would normally go. And I've got to the top of that climb and
I really am genuinely shattered. And I've only done 20k. Got 80 to go underneath. It's such a beautiful place, isn't it? But I'm I'm now dreading every climb and everybody's
passing me. The ultra running community is really quite
small and you can travel all over the world and not be surprised to bump into somebody
you know. Step up. Dave Ross from Hermes. Running organizer of the Thames Meander Marathon. Steve Cousins. Here my man for my run. Hi, dave Ross, yeah, not too bad. Torn meniscus, damaged cartilage. Oh, no. We're going to carry on, we're going to soldier
and we're going to do this bad boy. You're going to do it? I will. I'll get there. Just maybe not in the time I was hoping for. I wanted under 26 and a half hours. We've got yeah, let's just do it. No matter what we do, as long as we get the
job done. Cheers, Dave. Have a good one. See you in a bite. How's it going? That first climb got me. Didn't realize how steep it was and I took
it too fast. I need a rest now. I will. Thank you. Hello, Ian. How's Ian doing? Ian's jacket. Ian wants to go home, but Ian's pushing on. Good. Nice to see you, buddy. Andy, you take care. Ian did transvocania. How many times have you done it now? Three? Yes. Same as me. So we've both done transvalcania three times. What do you reckon? The comparison transv is just brutal from
start. Just from the start. I think this is spread out. I think it'll make it a bit easier. Okay, so I just need to chill out a bit, don't
I? I think so, but I haven't done the second
I haven't done this one before. Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll see how it goes. Yeah. Well done. Good job, buddy. So after the first two aid stations at Betone
and Bernati, there's a short downhill section and then you cross the border from Italy to
Switzerland and on to the third aid station at Arnold Van. 28 and a half kilometers in 5 hours 25 minutes. And going to have another cup of coffee, some
bread, some cheese and maybe some soup and sit here for five minutes and just recover
again and then get on. It's going to be one step in front of the
dealer today. Just get to the end anytime we can. It's getting a bit later in the afternoon
now. We are on a big climb and going into the clouds,
it's going to start getting foggy. 30 km done. So not 20 miles yet. 6 hours and nine minutes. So it's time to put a jacket on, I think. I guarantee you there is an absolutely beautiful
view that way. So this is cold. Ferret, 2537 meters. Thank you. Sorry. Got it. This is the highest we're going to be today. Jason just went harder than I thought. Yeah, just breathing. Yeah, breathing is the descent from Grand
Carl Farade to Lafoole is really quite long, but I enjoyed it. It reminded me a lot of England back home. The weather, the terrain underfoot, all very
similar to the south coast where I run. By now I was starting to feel like I was getting
into the race a little bit. There it is. That's the marathon covered. Forty two K. Eight hours, twenty three minutes
for a marathon. 8 hours, 23 minutes for a marathon. Okay. La for a minute. My watch. We've still we still haven't even climbed
past the elevation that we're supposed to climb. We're only on 2700 meters elevation. Another 3000 to climb. Very busy. A station, nice bit over there where people
have left messages, video messages, and they're playing them back to people as they come in. Just leaving La Fooli aid station at 43 km. So at seven, seven or 8, go to halfway. We're in Switzerland now. I don't know where the border was, but we've
crossed from Italy into Switzerland. I'll just let my food settle. I've had some soup, I've had some cheese,
had some dark chocolate. I've tried to give my legs a bit of a massage
and my stomach is feeling a bit queasy now, so I just need to settle it down. So I'm not going to do any running at the
moment. By now it was definitely raining. It was getting darker, it was muddy, underfoot,
but the scenery was still awe inspiring and I was actually feeling relatively good. From La Fooli to the next aid station at Champaign
Lac, there's a distance of around about 14. This involves a downhill section and then
an uphill. I felt I ran really quite well on the downhill
section, so according to my watch, this is halfway. 50. On my watch, 9 hours, 51 minutes. Hi, guys. Nelson. Obviously, if I was to keep the same pace
up for the second half, I would come in under 20 hours. But the likelihood of that, with three big
climbs and another climb not quite so big, I don't know. Not sure it's going to happen, really, but
we'll just keep on going. I'm not as despondent as I was earlier. So there is a mini checkpoint and water top
up station at Prada four here, just before we begin the climb up to Champagne La. Okay. What's your name? Ryan. Ryan from where? Denver, Colorado. Oh, awesome. Well, this weather is a bit different here. Yeah. Have you done this before? No, first time. First time in Chamoni? No, second time. I went out and did part of TDs once in 2012. Okay. Wow. It was a real rainy, nasty year. What made worse than this? What made you come back today? Just want to basically take revenge on Shamani. Good for you. And do something a little different. So yeah. Well, have a good run. You too. We're halfway through. Yeah. So it's 07:00 in the evening and the darkness
hasn't come yet. And you can just still see some of the high
peaks up there. Look. Ala. And then came the climb. You know, by comparison, it wasn't that bad,
but it just made me feel really tired again. So this is Champai Lacquer. I've been here a while now because I panicked
because I couldn't find my spare battery. 58 km. Officially, this place is 55 km, so I've done,
like, 3. Absolutely shattered. But three massive clients, huge clients trying
to eat pasta. I got some coffee. So I've done 63 km possible. Yeah, but it's 61. Yeah, 60 it is 61 and sorry. It's all right. No problem. We've climbed 3300 meters of elevation. We've left Champagne Lack about 4 km ago. So we're now going to start a big climb and
then down into Triennet. I don't know if you can see the view of the
town down there. I'm just having a rest because that was a
very long, steep climb. We're still not quite finished, but we're
getting there. Now it's shallowed out a bit, but we've got
two more of those climbs to go yet. That's the end of the long climb done. So we're just descending now to Treent. This is a little stop called Lace Yet. Got five k to go to Trience and then we've
got another big, long climb. The Utmb organization had been running races
round Mont Blanc now for 15 years, so it's safe to say they know a little bit about what
they're doing. And honestly, it really is impeccable. From the volunteers, to the food, to the way
the aid stations are organized, to the support outside the aid stations, they've really got
it down to a T. You couldn't ask for anything better, so they've got a garmin. Stand here to help with your watch if you
got a problem. This is Trienne now. By the time I reached Trent, I knew that barring
some kind of disaster, I was going to finish the race, but it wasn't going to be in 20
hours. So, 72 km officially, I've got way more than
that on my watch. If you can get in and out of a checkpoint
quickly, then great, do that. But if you need to use an aid station, use
it. Rest, eat, mentally, recover in preparation
for the next part of your race. That's what they're there for. Okay, let's get out of here. Okay. About to start the climb. I've got 78 km on my watch, but it's probably
70, 316 hours, 38 minutes. Well done, guys. Good job. Well done. Thank you. Well done. How you doing in, mate? We'll get there okay. We're nearly at the top of the climb, so the
next A session is valoristine in about 6 km from now. This is a little medical tent at Cassette. I think we're about 1900 meters. I just keep taking, like, breaks to sit, to
lie down as I climb. We're not at the top of this climb yet, but
we're not far off. Nice fire. Okay. Another really long descent, but now we're
in BallastIn and we've got about 17 or 18 km left. I think my watch says 80, 819 hours, 28 minutes
so far. This guy was hilarious. At Champagne Lac, I could hear a horn from
miles away, but I never saw who was playing it. And then I did see him at Trient, and then
again he turns up here at Valasene. Okay. According to officials, 17 go. 700 meters of ascent left. Let's get on with it and get it out of the
way, shall we? That's where we are. That's what we have left to do. So let's go and do it messy. Look what we've got to negotiate at the end
of this race. We've got nine and a half k to go and it's
not runnable at all. It's just rocks, rocky rootie. Horrific, especially on completely trashed
legs like I've got. This section of the course is actually a diversion
from the usual route. Normally it's far less technical. I was so tired. My legs were hurting, my brain was aching. I just wanted it to finish. But we just kept going up. Just over eight k to go. 22 hours, 13 minutes still climbing. My watch has one hundred k now, but there
should be only six k to go. But it's going to be more than six k. It's got to be everything's longer. It's going to be at least seven, if not eight
more kilometers. We're still going up there. Look, I put my poles away ages ago because
I thought we were coming down. If you've suffered in an ultra, you'll know
that feeling of longing for the last aid station to appear. We were waiting for Lager at 1900 meters. Would it ever come finally past that aid station
back there? I didn't stop. Just want to get home now. So downhill all the way now, but it's obviously
going to be steep. Six, seven, eight k, who knows? My watch is on 101 km. So that's the end of the race and we've done. 5900 meters of elevation. So that's it for elevation. As a final reminder of who's really in charge,
the mountain kept me climbing longer than I'd expected and time was now running out. The 20 hours goal had gone long ago and now
even the 24 hours target was slipping away. I had to run. It just comes to the end. We're going to make it under 24 hours. Not the original goal, but it'll do. I didn't respect Mont Blanc. I thought it would be easy business. It's been really hard. It's a bit weird because crossing the finish
line, I didn't really take it in because I was trying so hard to get under 24 hours. Just a few hours later and I was in the crowd
to welcome home Xavier Thevenard, the Utmb winner for 2018, his third victory at the
170 kilometer race. He's also the only person to have won the
Utmb CCC, the TDs and the 55 kilometer OCC race. It's and then it was an absolute pleasure
to see Britain's Damien Hall finally break the top ten at Utmb, finishing fifth this
year. Also a massive well done to Tom Evans, who
won my race, the CCC, and to Harry Jones, who came eight. Rogers I finished the 2018 CTC, couldn't make
20 hours. 23 57 is the best I could do. I really didn't respect the mountain enough. I should have trained harder. I should have realized how tough those hills
were going to be. But we got it done. And we come back again and do it better next
time. From Film my run. Take care, do. Subscribe to the Film My Run YouTube channel
and we'll see for another marathon, another ultra, another crazy adventure. Next time. Bye.

[00:02] Welcome to film my run.

you have absolutely no idea how terrifying
[05:18] pre race mandatory kit check and number collection
can be.
[05:23] Honestly, have I remembered everything?
[05:25] Two head torches taped seams on my coat.
[05:29] Have I got my ID?
[05:31] Did I remember to pack that extra layer?
[05:34] What if my gloves aren't waterproof?
[05:37] Will I be disqualified before I even get to
the start line?
[05:42] Honestly, it's terrifying.
[05:52] It's 06:20 in the morning, so we're in the
queue at Plaster Monblanc to get the bus through
[06:04] the tunnel to call My Air.
[06:07] And we start at 09:00 A.m..
[06:10] So I've got my porridge, I've got some coffee

[06:16] We're all good.

[07:11] Here we are in corn my air.
[07:19] This is in Italy.
[07:24] We're about to run 100 km over 100 km.
[07:35] About 6000 meters of ascent all the way.
[07:43] Well, halfway around all over the world here.
[08:05] We've got two minutes to go to Start CCC 2018.
[09:15] The atmosphere at the start is really incredible.
[09:18] They really ramp it up.
[09:19] And we started as though we were running a
ten k race.
[09:23] To be honest, looking at the footage, it does
look like the first few hundred meters is
[09:29] actually downhill.
[09:30] Although I completely forgot about that when
we started climbing.
[09:36] Cormayere is lovely.
[09:38] It's like the opposite version of Chamoni
on the Italian side of Montblanc, and it comes
[09:43] at around about 70 km into the full 100 miles
utmb race.
[09:51] So literally ten minutes into the race and

[09:56] Loads of people are still running.
[10:00] My guess is they're all full of adrenaline.
[10:03] Not really thinking about how that's going
to tie them out at 90 km into the race.
[10:09] So I've swallowed my pride.
[10:13] Walking USA representing here.
[10:18] We're here.
[10:19] Loving the shirt and the hat.
[10:22] What's going on with that, then?
[10:23] Hey, you know, number one, it keeps the sun
off my face, so there's a positive there.
[10:28] Number two, my wife finds me at every aid
station, and I'm never going to argue with
[10:33] that.
[10:34] That is absolutely true.
[10:35] We know that very well.
[10:36] A sea of orange or blue or whatever.
[10:39] Shirt, neon spandex.
[10:40] That's the key here.
[10:43] Avoid that and you're good.
[10:54] Check shirt.
[10:58] Hi.
[11:01] 450 meters climbed and it's been climbing
all the way since the start.
[11:13] We've covered just over 2 miles.
[11:14] Two and a half miles in 42 minutes.
[11:22] Okay, so the reports are that it's going to
be cloudy today and quite foggy tonight.
[11:32] So take in the views while you can because
there's not going to be many of them later
[11:37] on.
[11:38] But this is what we came for.
[11:41] So just over five k in 51 minutes so far.
[11:47] And yourself?
[11:51] Yeah, not too bad.
[11:58] Wait for the rain.
[12:01] Yeah.
[12:02] And this got a fog.
[12:03] Yeah, we enjoyed the rain.
[12:04] We done this before?
[12:07] No, no, first time.
[12:10] So it is it's on the OCC two years ago.
[12:13] Okay.
[12:14] The shorter version.
[12:15] So you got a bit of experience of it.
[12:23] Yeah.
[12:25] That is 1300 meters climbed.
[12:34] That hill has just killed me.
[12:39] You know, we're only ten k in 2 hours, four
minutes gone and absolutely shattered.
[12:43] Climbing that just now.
[12:44] And we still got all that to go up there.
[12:46] You can see the climb is going up there.
[12:53] Okay.
[12:54] Top of the first climb, ten point 66 km running,
2 hours 17 minutes, and we've climbed 1434
[13:06] meters.
[13:12] I think it's good to have goals and to set
yourself targets in a race.
[13:17] Before I started, I thought that 20 hours
was a realistic target for CCC.
[13:22] However, two and a quarter hours in and I
was already beginning to question whether
[13:27] I'd complete the course at all.
[14:23] So in the early stages of a trail race, especially
one that's 100K or 100 miles, when you've
[14:30] got descents that are steep like this, you
cannot go busting your quads out because you
[14:36] will be ruined for the rest of the race.
[14:38] So, depending on your level of fitness and
your level of experience, just watch yourself
[14:45] down these first inclines that you don't go
overly fast and ruin yourself for the second
[14:52] half.
[14:53] Just come into the first aid session.
[14:57] 15 km in 2 hours, 52 minutes.
[15:03] Agua.
[15:04] So this is the first checkpoint, refuge, baton,
aqua, water, nephew.
[15:15] Awesome, Gabrielle.
[15:17] Thank you, Gabrielle.
[15:21] Good work.
[15:24] Thank you, buddy.
[15:28] I think it's a given that in any ultra race
you're going to have a few low moments.
[15:33] But to have my first wobble so early was really
worrying.
[15:39] Thank you.
[15:41] One thing that did keep my spirits up, though,
was the amazing scenery.
[15:45] I've run in some great places, but this was
incredible.
[15:52] Okay, we are 20 km in just over 20 km in 3
hours 44 minutes and I'm suffering a crisis
[16:07] of confidence.
[16:08] I didn't account for how steep and long that
first climb was.
[16:16] I think I probably went off too quickly.
[16:20] There's a lot of pressure because it's single
track a lot of the way up, so you've got pressure
[16:27] from people behind to keep going faster than
perhaps you would normally go.
[16:33] And I've got to the top of that climb and
I really am genuinely shattered.
[16:36] And I've only done 20k.
[16:39] Got 80 to go underneath.
[16:44] It's such a beautiful place, isn't it?
[16:49] But I'm I'm now dreading every climb and everybody's
passing me.
[16:59] The ultra running community is really quite
small and you can travel all over the world
[17:09] and not be surprised to bump into somebody
you know.
[17:13] Step up.
[17:14] Dave Ross from Hermes.
[17:16] Running organizer of the Thames Meander Marathon.
[17:18] Steve Cousins.
[17:19] Here my man for my run.
[17:22] Hi, dave Ross, yeah, not too bad.
[17:24] Torn meniscus, damaged cartilage.
[17:26] Oh, no.
[17:27] We're going to carry on, we're going to soldier
and we're going to do this bad boy.
[17:33] You're going to do it?
[17:34] I will.
[17:35] I'll get there.
[17:36] Just maybe not in the time I was hoping for.
[17:37] I wanted under 26 and a half hours.
[17:38] We've got yeah, let's just do it.
[17:39] No matter what we do, as long as we get the
job done.
[17:42] Cheers, Dave.
[17:45] Have a good one.
[17:50] See you in a bite.
[17:56] How's it going?
[18:00] That first climb got me.
[18:02] Didn't realize how steep it was and I took
it too fast.
[18:05] I need a rest now.
[18:06] I will.
[18:07] Thank you.
[18:08] Hello, Ian.
[18:09] How's Ian doing?
[18:10] Ian's jacket.
[18:11] Ian wants to go home, but Ian's pushing on.
[18:16] Good.
[18:17] Nice to see you, buddy.
[18:18] Andy, you take care.
[18:19] Ian did transvocania.
[18:20] How many times have you done it now?
[18:24] Three?
[18:25] Yes.
[18:26] Same as me.
[18:27] So we've both done transvalcania three times.
[18:28] What do you reckon?
[18:29] The comparison transv is just brutal from
start.
[18:31] Just from the start.
[18:32] I think this is spread out.
[18:34] I think it'll make it a bit easier.
[18:36] Okay, so I just need to chill out a bit, don't
I?
[18:38] I think so, but I haven't done the second
I haven't done this one before.
[18:41] Okay.
[18:42] Yeah.
[18:43] Well, we'll see how it goes.
[18:48] Yeah.
[18:54] Well done.
[19:06] Good job, buddy.
[19:24] So after the first two aid stations at Betone
and Bernati, there's a short downhill section
[19:32] and then you cross the border from Italy to
Switzerland and on to the third aid station
[19:39] at Arnold Van.
[19:43] 28 and a half kilometers in 5 hours 25 minutes.
[19:58] And going to have another cup of coffee, some
bread, some cheese and maybe some soup and
[20:05] sit here for five minutes and just recover
again and then get on.
[20:09] It's going to be one step in front of the
dealer today.
[20:11] Just get to the end anytime we can.
[20:26] It's getting a bit later in the afternoon
now.
[20:41] We are on a big climb and going into the clouds,
it's going to start getting foggy.
[20:42] 30 km done.
[20:43] So not 20 miles yet.
[20:44] 6 hours and nine minutes.
[20:45] So it's time to put a jacket on, I think.
[20:47] I guarantee you there is an absolutely beautiful
view that way.
[20:50] So this is cold.
[20:51] Ferret, 2537 meters.
[20:52] Thank you.
[20:53] Sorry.
[20:54] Got it.
[20:55] This is the highest we're going to be today.
[21:03] Jason just went harder than I thought.
[21:36] Yeah, just breathing.
[21:50] Yeah, breathing is the descent from Grand
Carl Farade to Lafoole is really quite long,
[22:08] but I enjoyed it.
[22:09] It reminded me a lot of England back home.
[22:12] The weather, the terrain underfoot, all very
similar to the south coast where I run.
[22:17] By now I was starting to feel like I was getting
into the race a little bit.
[22:21] There it is.
[22:24] That's the marathon covered.
[22:26] Forty two K. Eight hours, twenty three minutes
for a marathon.
[22:32] 8 hours, 23 minutes for a marathon.
[22:42] Okay.
[22:48] La for a minute.
[23:00] My watch.
[23:01] We've still we still haven't even climbed
past the elevation that we're supposed to
[23:11] climb.
[23:12] We're only on 2700 meters elevation.
[23:16] Another 3000 to climb.
[23:19] Very busy.
[23:20] A station, nice bit over there where people
have left messages, video messages, and they're
[23:31] playing them back to people as they come in.
[23:48] Just leaving La Fooli aid station at 43 km.
[23:55] So at seven, seven or 8, go to halfway.
[24:02] We're in Switzerland now.
[24:03] I don't know where the border was, but we've
crossed from Italy into Switzerland.
[24:10] I'll just let my food settle.
[24:15] I've had some soup, I've had some cheese,
had some dark chocolate.
[24:21] I've tried to give my legs a bit of a massage
and my stomach is feeling a bit queasy now,
[24:26] so I just need to settle it down.
[24:27] So I'm not going to do any running at the
moment.
[24:37] By now it was definitely raining.
[24:42] It was getting darker, it was muddy, underfoot,
but the scenery was still awe inspiring and
[24:49] I was actually feeling relatively good.
[25:16] From La Fooli to the next aid station at Champaign
Lac, there's a distance of around about 14.
[25:25] This involves a downhill section and then
an uphill.
[25:29] I felt I ran really quite well on the downhill
section, so according to my watch, this is
[25:37] halfway.
[25:40] 50.
[25:43] On my watch, 9 hours, 51 minutes.
[25:47] Hi, guys.
[25:49] Nelson.
[25:50] Obviously, if I was to keep the same pace
up for the second half, I would come in under
[26:00] 20 hours.
[26:01] But the likelihood of that, with three big
climbs and another climb not quite so big,
[26:10] I don't know.
[26:13] Not sure it's going to happen, really, but
we'll just keep on going.
[26:19] I'm not as despondent as I was earlier.
[26:33] So there is a mini checkpoint and water top
up station at Prada four here, just before
[26:39] we begin the climb up to Champagne La.
[26:41] Okay.
[26:42] What's your name?
[26:43] Ryan.
[26:44] Ryan from where?
[26:45] Denver, Colorado.
[26:46] Oh, awesome.
[26:47] Well, this weather is a bit different here.
[26:49] Yeah.
[26:50] Have you done this before?
[26:52] No, first time.
[26:54] First time in Chamoni?
[26:55] No, second time.
[26:56] I went out and did part of TDs once in 2012.
[27:00] Okay.
[27:01] Wow.
[27:02] It was a real rainy, nasty year.
[27:04] What made worse than this?
[27:05] What made you come back today?
[27:07] Just want to basically take revenge on Shamani.
[27:12] Good for you.
[27:13] And do something a little different.
[27:15] So yeah.
[27:16] Well, have a good run.
[27:18] You too.
[27:19] We're halfway through.
[27:20] Yeah.
[27:21] So it's 07:00 in the evening and the darkness
hasn't come yet.
[27:27] And you can just still see some of the high
peaks up there.
[27:35] Look.
[27:39] Ala.
[27:43] And then came the climb.
[27:45] You know, by comparison, it wasn't that bad,
but it just made me feel really tired again.
[28:01] So this is Champai Lacquer.
[28:05] I've been here a while now because I panicked
because I couldn't find my spare battery.
[28:15] 58 km.
[28:16] Officially, this place is 55 km, so I've done,
like, 3.
[28:31] Absolutely shattered.
[28:35] But three massive clients, huge clients trying
to eat pasta.
[28:50] I got some coffee.
[28:52] So I've done 63 km possible.
[28:54] Yeah, but it's 61.
[28:55] Yeah, 60 it is 61 and sorry.
[28:57] It's all right.
[28:59] No problem.
[29:00] We've climbed 3300 meters of elevation.
[29:04] We've left Champagne Lack about 4 km ago.
[29:09] So we're now going to start a big climb and
then down into Triennet.
[29:13] I don't know if you can see the view of the
town down there.
[29:20] I'm just having a rest because that was a
very long, steep climb.
[29:24] We're still not quite finished, but we're
getting there.
[29:28] Now it's shallowed out a bit, but we've got
two more of those climbs to go yet.
[29:39] That's the end of the long climb done.
[29:42] So we're just descending now to Treent.
[29:45] This is a little stop called Lace Yet.
[29:48] Got five k to go to Trience and then we've
got another big, long climb.
[30:05] The Utmb organization had been running races
round Mont Blanc now for 15 years, so it's
[30:11] safe to say they know a little bit about what
they're doing.
[30:14] And honestly, it really is impeccable.
[30:15] From the volunteers, to the food, to the way
the aid stations are organized, to the support
[30:22] outside the aid stations, they've really got
it down to a T. You couldn't ask for anything
[30:27] better, so they've got a garmin.
[30:30] Stand here to help with your watch if you
got a problem.
[30:35] This is Trienne now.
[30:38] By the time I reached Trent, I knew that barring
some kind of disaster, I was going to finish
[30:44] the race, but it wasn't going to be in 20
hours.
[30:48] So, 72 km officially, I've got way more than
that on my watch.
[30:56] If you can get in and out of a checkpoint
quickly, then great, do that.
[31:00] But if you need to use an aid station, use
it.
[31:04] Rest, eat, mentally, recover in preparation
for the next part of your race.
[31:09] That's what they're there for.
[31:17] Okay, let's get out of here.
[31:32] Okay.
[31:33] About to start the climb.
[31:36] I've got 78 km on my watch, but it's probably
70, 316 hours, 38 minutes.
[31:44] Well done, guys.
[31:48] Good job.
[31:50] Well done.
[31:52] Thank you.
[31:54] Well done.
[31:56] How you doing in, mate?
[32:02] We'll get there okay.
[32:07] We're nearly at the top of the climb, so the
next A session is valoristine in about 6 km
[32:21] from now.
[32:22] This is a little medical tent at Cassette.
[32:26] I think we're about 1900 meters.
[32:30] I just keep taking, like, breaks to sit, to
lie down as I climb.
[32:35] We're not at the top of this climb yet, but
we're not far off.
[32:38] Nice fire.
[32:40] Okay.
[32:41] Another really long descent, but now we're
in BallastIn and we've got about 17 or 18
[32:57] km left.
[32:59] I think my watch says 80, 819 hours, 28 minutes
so far.
[33:10] This guy was hilarious.
[33:11] At Champagne Lac, I could hear a horn from
miles away, but I never saw who was playing
[33:17] it.
[33:18] And then I did see him at Trient, and then
again he turns up here at Valasene.
[33:25] Okay.
[33:26] According to officials, 17 go.
[33:31] 700 meters of ascent left.
[33:40] Let's get on with it and get it out of the
way, shall we?
[33:49] That's where we are.
[33:50] That's what we have left to do.
[33:53] So let's go and do it messy.
[34:07] Look what we've got to negotiate at the end
of this race.
[34:17] We've got nine and a half k to go and it's
not runnable at all.
[34:26] It's just rocks, rocky rootie.
[34:31] Horrific, especially on completely trashed
legs like I've got.
[34:37] This section of the course is actually a diversion
from the usual route.
[34:43] Normally it's far less technical.
[34:45] I was so tired.
[34:46] My legs were hurting, my brain was aching.
[34:48] I just wanted it to finish.
[34:50] But we just kept going up.
[34:53] Just over eight k to go.
[34:59] 22 hours, 13 minutes still climbing.
[35:24] My watch has one hundred k now, but there
should be only six k to go.
[35:33] But it's going to be more than six k.
[35:37] It's got to be everything's longer.
[35:42] It's going to be at least seven, if not eight
more kilometers.
[35:52] We're still going up there.
[35:56] Look, I put my poles away ages ago because
I thought we were coming down.
[36:07] If you've suffered in an ultra, you'll know
that feeling of longing for the last aid station
[36:13] to appear.
[36:14] We were waiting for Lager at 1900 meters.
[36:19] Would it ever come finally past that aid station
back there?
[36:24] I didn't stop.
[36:25] Just want to get home now.
[36:30] So downhill all the way now, but it's obviously
going to be steep.
[36:36] Six, seven, eight k, who knows?
[36:41] My watch is on 101 km.
[36:43] So that's the end of the race and we've done.
[36:51] 5900 meters of elevation.
[36:54] So that's it for elevation.
[37:00] As a final reminder of who's really in charge,
the mountain kept me climbing longer than
[37:06] I'd expected and time was now running out.
[37:09] The 20 hours goal had gone long ago and now
even the 24 hours target was slipping away.
[37:16] I had to run.
[37:26] It just comes to the end.
[38:24] We're going to make it under 24 hours.
[38:56] Not the original goal, but it'll do.
[39:01] I didn't respect Mont Blanc.
[39:05] I thought it would be easy business.
[40:31] It's been really hard.
[40:32] It's a bit weird because crossing the finish
line, I didn't really take it in because I
[40:34] was trying so hard to get under 24 hours.
[40:58] Just a few hours later and I was in the crowd
to welcome home Xavier Thevenard, the Utmb
[41:04] winner for 2018, his third victory at the
170 kilometer race.
[41:11] He's also the only person to have won the
Utmb CCC, the TDs and the 55 kilometer OCC
[41:25] race.
[41:33] It's and then it was an absolute pleasure
to see Britain's Damien Hall finally break
[41:44] the top ten at Utmb, finishing fifth this
year.
[41:50] Also a massive well done to Tom Evans, who
won my race, the CCC, and to Harry Jones,
[42:06] who came eight.
[42:13] Rogers I finished the 2018 CTC, couldn't make
20 hours.
[42:20] 23 57 is the best I could do.
[42:22] I really didn't respect the mountain enough.
[42:25] I should have trained harder.
[42:27] I should have realized how tough those hills
were going to be.
[42:30] But we got it done.
[42:33] And we come back again and do it better next
time.
