shoved them down my throat got my water bottles filled and got out in about three minutes it's about nearly five o'clock in the morning uh nearly four o'clock in the morning um [Applause] so we've got 83 84 kilometers to go we've gone uh all the way up here where the red is to there we go all the way to there to go still an awful lot to do so this is uh fontanales aid station um [Music] it's hard work because it's been raining it's very very muddy indeed so it that's slowing us down a lot [Music] it's just after 7am but 10 past 7 in the morning it's wet it's cold it's windy this is not what you expect from gran canaria [Music] big advantage we're also over the canarians that is true the spanish the spanish don't like this weather at all i mean it's it's a tough one for us but you know at least we're used to it [Music] very muddy and very dodgy but what a beautiful valley this is this i remember this valley from last time uh when i came down it almost in the dark um but we're now coming down in the light and it's absolutely beautiful 55 kilometers is done about 73 or so to go nine hours 53 minutes just crossing that down there still raining still blowy and no sign of the sunshine i hope my wife and the kids are getting on a little better [Music] [Music] okay we are at artanara aid station um this is about 66 67 kilometers into the race so we're we're over halfway but this is beyond a joke now it is so cold i would never have believed it could be that cold in gran canaria the wind is absolutely howling it's freezing it's raining and it's just been non-stop the whole time since since we started climbing back up again there's plenty of people here who've decided that's that's just that's it oh sorry there are plenty of people here who've decided that is it they've had enough they're not carrying on um i'm gonna see if i can make it any further i'm not afraid to pull it if it gets ridiculous but um this kind gentleman what's your name john john has lent me his gloves if they fit me i'll put them on so we'll see what happens we'll try and get a little bit further okay north side over there still horrendously windy rainy cloudy south side over there occasionally we feel the sun touching our legs and like just the hint that better weather is on the way still climbing still about 55 56 kilometers to go and it's about 13 hours 45 minutes into the race [Music] [Music] right so we've actually got some sunshine although there is still drizzle in the air i've come down off the mountain into ted jada where there is an egg station so i've just had some crisps some chocolate biscuits and legs are feeling pretty wrecked i have to say well ahead of cut-off by the way but um i'm i was hoping to do 24 hours for this race and that is gradually slipping away as my legs feel more and more tired and i'm less able to run down the hills now uphill is well in fact up hill and downhill are a nightmare because of the mud although it may clear up um in terms of weather the mud on the ground is just horrendous now [Music] so once again back up in the clouds after another six seven hundred meter climb but the weather is a bit better it's still horrible over that way but we're protected at the moment and it's definitely brightening up down on the uh the lower levels so we're at garanon 43 kilometers till we finish we've got a couple of little ups and there's a very steep downhill coming up as well yeah yeah yeah that's good yeah okay glasses [Applause] [Music] right let's go [Music] [Music] okay this is a bit more like it running across another dam with a marathon to go 42 kilometers [Music] there it is that's what we're on our way to see another 250 meters of climbing i will get this finished i am [Music] suffering now [Music] how about that eh this is what we should have been seeing all day so the valleys come come [Music] the mountains over to the sea and over in the distance there that is tenerife that is tied right to the highest mountain in spain 3500 metres tall absolutely beautiful view down there in the valley as well that's what we should have had all day not that wind and rain [Music] [Music] [Music] what's this so we've made it to the final aid station so from here 14 kilometers left up the side of the mountain over there um [Music] [Music] this route is absolutely stunning but it's quite technical and you've got to watch your footing so you can see the route that the runners are taking and we literally snake all the way down the mountain [Music] it now feels like we're running through the jungle [Music] so stephen doesn't actually get to experience any of the views that we've seen [Music] well i have no idea how i finished this this is that has been really hard work the family have come out to see me hello thank you for staying i'm sorry i'm so late [Music] [Music] so that is trans cran canaria finished for another year hardest hardest race [Music] [Music] okay that is it for uh

[09:42] a little bit further
[09:53] okay
[09:55] north side
[09:56] over there
[09:58] still
[10:00] horrendously windy
[10:02] rainy cloudy
[10:05] south side
[10:06] over there
[10:09] occasionally
[10:10] we feel the sun
[10:13] touching our legs
[10:16] and
[10:17] like just the hint
[10:19] that
[10:20] better weather is on the way
[10:25] still climbing
[10:27] still
[10:28] about 55 56
[10:31] kilometers to go
[10:35] and it's about
[10:38] 13 hours 45 minutes
[10:41] into the race
[10:43] [Music]
[11:02] [Music]
[11:04] right so we've actually got some
[11:05] sunshine
[11:06] although there is still drizzle in the
[11:08] air
[11:09] i've
[11:11] come down off the mountain
[11:13] into ted jada
[11:16] where there is an egg station
[11:18] so i've just had some crisps
[11:20] some chocolate biscuits
[11:22] and legs are feeling pretty wrecked i
[11:24] have to say
[11:26] well ahead of cut-off by the way
[11:28] but um
[11:30] i'm i was hoping to do 24 hours for this
[11:33] race and that is gradually slipping away
[11:36] as my legs
[11:37] feel more and more tired
[11:40] and i'm less able to run down the hills
[11:43] now uphill is well in fact up hill and
[11:46] downhill are a nightmare
[11:47] because of the mud although
[11:50] it may clear up
[11:52] um
[11:53] in terms of weather
[11:55] the mud on the ground is just horrendous
[11:58] now
[12:02] [Music]
[12:08] so once again
[12:10] back up in the clouds after another
[12:13] six seven hundred meter climb
[12:17] but the weather is
[12:19] a bit better it's still horrible
[12:21] over that way but
[12:23] we're protected
[12:25] at the moment and it's definitely
[12:28] brightening up
[12:30] down on the uh
[12:32] the lower levels
[12:34] so we're at garanon
[12:37] 43 kilometers till we finish
[12:40] we've got a couple of little ups
[12:44] and there's a very steep downhill coming
[12:46] up as well
[12:48] yeah yeah yeah that's good yeah okay
[12:50] glasses
[12:52] [Applause]
[12:58] [Music]
[13:10] right
[13:12] let's go
[13:14] [Music]
[13:30] [Music]
[13:36] okay this is a bit more like it
[13:39] running across another dam
[13:43] with a marathon to go 42 kilometers
[13:50] [Music]
[14:05] there it is that's what we're on our way
[14:07] to see
[14:08] another
[14:09] 250 meters of climbing
[14:12] i will get this finished
[14:15] i am
[14:16] [Music]
[14:17] suffering now
[14:19] [Music]
[14:20] how about that eh
[14:22] this is what we should have been seeing
[14:24] all day
[14:25] so
[14:27] the valleys
[14:29] come come
[14:30] [Music]
[14:33] the mountains over to the sea
[14:36] and over in the distance there that is
[14:38] tenerife that is tied
[14:40] right to the highest mountain in spain
[14:43] 3500 metres tall
[14:47] absolutely
[14:48] beautiful view down there in the valley
[14:50] as well
[14:52] that's what we should have had all day
[14:56] not that wind and rain
[14:58] [Music]
[15:13] [Music]
[15:34] [Music]
[15:50] what's this
[15:55] so we've made it to the final aid
[15:57] station
[15:59] so from here 14 kilometers left
[16:03] up the side of the mountain over there
[16:09] um
[16:15] [Music]
[16:25] [Music]
[16:55] this route is absolutely stunning but
[16:58] it's quite technical
[17:00] and you've got to watch your footing
[17:04] so you can see the route that the
[17:06] runners are taking and we literally
[17:08] snake all the way down the mountain
[17:11] [Music]
[17:14] it now feels like we're running through
[17:16] the jungle
[17:18] [Music]
[17:24] so stephen doesn't actually get to
[17:25] experience any of the views that we've
[17:28] seen
[17:35] [Music]
