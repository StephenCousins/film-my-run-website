==================================================

[00:00] Last year, my wife did this in 11  hours 25. Beating that is all I  
[00:05] care about. The atmosphere is crazy. This is the best. I love it. Funk me,  
[00:28] of all the places to find you. Young guy, new guy, Vincent  
[00:33] Bouillard – he's coming down the hill.  Hayden Hawks, winner of CCC – he's just won  
[00:38] the biggest race in ultrarunning history. What a great finish line this always is.  
[00:54] It's the beauty and serenity of the mountains  and valleys around Mont Blanc that keeps us  
[00:59] coming back each year. That juxtaposed  with the immensely exhilarating atmosphere  
[01:05] generated in Chamonix during UTMB week. It's the highlight of the ultrarunning year  
[01:11] for many, and it all starts on Monday morning at  Place de l'Église – the start line of PTL. This  
[01:28] is the first race to go off during UTMB week. It's packed. There are loads of press standing  
[01:35] here. The crowds are huge  just for the start of PTL. 
[01:39] This is a massive race starting on Monday morning  and finishing on Friday, about the same time the  
[01:47] leaders of the UTMB full race come in. And  you're excited for the start of UTMB week? 
[01:53] Absolutely excited and so happy after one year  to prepare – each year, it’s just a pleasure. 
[02:01] Have a good week. Yes, fine. 
[02:02] See you on the trails. Yeah. 
[02:04] That was Catherine Poletti, one of the founders  of UTMB, who is a familiar sight at the start  
[02:10] of almost every race during UTMB week. The teams of runners in PTL will spend up  
[02:19] to 151 hours traversing 300 kilometres around the  Mont Blanc massif, climbing over 25,000 metres.  
[02:28] It's the longest and toughest of all the  week’s events, and we wouldn't see many of  
[02:33] those runners again until Friday or Saturday. It's almost mandatory to have a wander around  
[02:45] the stalls at the Ultra-Trail Village, especially  if you need to pick up any last-minute kit before  
[02:51] your race. It’s all part of the UTMB experience. We have the first winner of the week – the MCC,  
[03:00] which is the marathon distance  – coming in to finish right now.  
[03:13] We're just at the finish line waiting  for the first lady in the MCC. 
[03:24] With both male and female winners of the MCC  coming from France, it would be just the start  
[03:30] of an incredible week for French trail running. Having completed the OCC 54-kilometre race last  
[03:42] year, my wife Victoria had entered  the newest UTMB event: the ETC. It’s  
[03:49] a 15-kilometre run designed as a rather more  gentle introduction to trail and mountain running,  
[03:55] perhaps for the less experienced runner –  although with 1,200 metres of elevation gain,  
[04:01] gentle is a relative term. “Ready?” 
[04:04] “Yeah, let’s hope this one fits. This  year I've gone for a size bigger.” 
[04:16] So, we’re at the start line of TDS. We are waiting  in the elite start area for Mark Darbyshire,  
[04:24] who is the number one seed for TDS today,  from Great Britain. I'm hoping he's going  
[04:30] to arrive here any second now and I can have  a word with him before they start the race. 
[04:35] TDS starts on the Monday night, and many argue  it's a tougher race than the main UTMB event. 
[04:42] This is Mark Darbyshire –  at the start line of TDS. 
[04:47] Now, Mark has been unwell, but he is still  technically the number one seed for this race. 
[04:55] How are you feeling? "Yeah, no pressure  there. No pressure. All right, I think – yeah,  
[05:01] looking forward to it. Bit different here  to the UK. Big mountains out here, innit?" 
[05:07] Have you managed to get any vert in  at all? "Yeah, yeah, I’ve been all  
[05:11] right. Done a bit, been all right." Do you have a plan, given that you’ve  
[05:15] been unwell? "I don’t really know. I never have a  plan. Just go out fairly easy and hopefully build  
[05:25] as the race goes on. I think it’ll be a very  fast start." "Yeah, it will." "Not getting too  
[05:32] excited." "See you at the finish." “Five minutes to go. TDS 2024.” 
[06:00] Let’s hope for Mark Darbyshire and the UK. I spent three years trying to complete TDS  
[06:07] and finally got it done in 2022. It’s  advertised at around 145 kilometres,  
[06:14] but I think I had nearer to 160 by the time I  crossed the line. The late start time can be very  
[06:21] tough – it’s difficult to rest the day before, so  you're already tired before you've even started. 
[06:29] And there they go – off on their  journey on a Monday night. Some  
[06:35] of those guys won’t be finishing until Wednesday. One of the things we enjoy doing most as a family  
[06:50] in Chamonix is hiking. This year we decided  to pay our first ever visit to the White Lake. 
[06:57] We caught the train from Chamonix to Argentière  and started walking from there. It’s a decent  
[07:04] hike of around seven kilometres with 1,200  metres of elevation to get to the lake,  
[07:10] and it can be very crowded with tourists,  especially in the summer months. 
[07:17] Another amazing thing to do in Chamonix is  paragliding. For years we’ve stared up into  
[07:23] the sky at the paragliders jumping off the side  of the mountain and gently floating back down  
[07:29] to land in a field behind the town. You’d  never get me up there in a million years,  
[07:35] but my daughter Elsa has always wanted to try it. So this year, with absolutely no fear,  
[07:42] she ran off a big hill and soared  thousands of feet into the air.  
[07:46] They even did tricks – and Elsa ended up  upside down, 2,000 feet above the ground. 
[08:11] Tuesday came around and I caught  the bus to Italy for my race. 
[08:16] "Welcome to ETC. Welcome to Courmayeur. Let’s  go. Come on, let’s do it. We’ve got this." 
[08:24] Despite being effectively a gentle introduction  to UTMB races, we were still afforded the full  
[08:31] UTMB razmatazz at the start line, and we set off  through Courmayeur on a similar route to both the  
[08:37] CCC and TDS races. The race was set off in waves,  however, there were still bottlenecks early on the  
[08:47] trails, and I was never on my own at any point. The only climb of the race was, at times,  
[08:55] very steep with some technical sections.  It was a really interesting mix. 
[09:01] "You can see it’s quite a steep climb, and the  runners are just meandering down the mountain." 
[09:14] Once we got beyond the tree line, the  views were stunning. This is what we're  
[09:21] here for. Just look at that. ETC, like TDS, isn't part of  
[09:32] the official World Series, and so you  don't need any running stones to enter.  
[09:37] However, you do receive one stone for finishing,  which you can then use towards perhaps stepping  
[09:45] up to OCC next time. This is the descent. 
[09:58] ETC made me feel part of the UTMB experience,  and I thoroughly recommend it as a really fun  
[10:04] event – or a test race to see  if you like mountain running. 
[10:27] Whilst Victoria was in Italy, I was  back in France, taking part in the  
[10:32] Run for Adventure Shakeout Run, which  we do every year with Loyd and Liga. 
[10:38] "I'm Chris. What are you doing tomorrow?" "Tomorrow I'm doing TDS." 
[10:42] "No, I’m not. Shall we start that  video again?" "Right. I’ll just...  
[10:46] I’ll cut that out. We'll do it in the  edit. It's all fine. No need to worry." 
[10:50] "Tomorrow I’m doing the OCC." "How are you feeling about it?" "I'm  
[10:54] feeling good. I'm feeling excited to be doing it.  It'll only be my second proper mountain race. And  
[11:05] yeah, I mean, I've never been to Chamonix  before. The scenery is amazing. Just everything  
[11:10] about it is just racked up to number 13 on  the scale, isn't it? It's just incredible.  
[11:19] Thanks, guys." We're on the running track  
[11:26] in Chamonix – and there's a guy running super  fast around the outside lanes, and he shouted  
[11:32] at us because we’re going really slow. It’s always a nice event early in the  
[11:37] week to meet a few people and have a jog  around the famous 300-metre running track,  
[11:42] with spectacular views of Mont Blanc. And  of course, no shakeout run in Chamonix would  
[11:48] be complete without a trip to Moody’s Café  afterwards for coffee and chocolate brownies. 
[12:04] Well, that was a rush. I suddenly realised  at 3:40pm that I needed to collect my race  
[12:13] bib by 4:00pm. So here I am. I raced from  a café all the way back to the campsite,  
[12:19] got my race vest, and made it back just in time. Collecting your race bib used to be the most  
[12:27] stressful moment of the entire week because of the  strict mandatory kit requirements. Get it wrong,  
[12:34] and you risk not being able to run a race you may  have spent years trying to get into. Thankfully,  
[12:40] there’s no kit check anymore these days, so  it’s a much more relaxed affair – unless,  
[12:45] of course, you’ve had to run two  kilometres to get there on time. 
[12:51] To collect your bib, you need your passport  or photo ID, and your race vest so they can  
[12:57] attach the tracker. But you don’t need a kit  check anymore – unless there’s a random one. 
[13:08] Okay, that’s it done. Lastminute.com. Now I’ll go back to the café where my  
[13:15] children are sitting, eating ice cream quite  happily on their own with my credit card. 
[13:32] Over the years, I’ve completed three  different UTMB events. I started with CCC,  
[13:37] the 100km race in 2018. I then spent three  years trying to finish TDS – with a DNF,  
[13:46] a COVID cancellation, and an abandoned race  – before eventually completing it in 2022. 
[13:52] I ran the Big Dance in 2023, and so this year I  opted for OCC – shorter than my usual preferred  
[14:00] distances, but that wouldn’t make it any easier,  as I was about to find out over the next 12 hours. 
[14:09] This would be my first time beginning a  race in Switzerland, because OCC starts  
[14:14] in the small town of Orsières. The  buses had dropped us off quite early,  
[14:19] so there was plenty of time to prepare,  eat, drink, and relax in the square. 
[14:24] I was also in wave two of the race, so I could  enjoy watching the build-up as more and more  
[14:29] runners filled the square and the faster  runners made their way to the timing mat.  
[14:36] There were more than a few nerves jangling as wave  two was called forward, but I heard my friend Owen  
[14:42] on the mic and spotted Catherine Poletti waiting  under the arch, so I knew everything was in order. 
[14:49] For some reason, I managed to  get to the front of wave two. 
[14:53] I don’t really want to be at the front  of wave two... but we’ll have to go with  
[14:57] the flow now that we’re here. “Stephen, how are you feeling?  
[15:00] Ready to rock and roll?” “I feel more  nervous than I should be, I think.” 
[15:06] “Stephen, we look forward to seeing you at the  finish line in Chamonix. What do you think?  
[15:10] Maybe... are we talking seven, eight, nine hours?  What do you think?” “Last year, my wife did this  
[15:15] in 11 hours 25. Beating that is all I care about.” “Best of luck,  
[15:21] we’ll see you later on at Champex, Steve.” Do you know what? I had a feeling... he was  
[15:25] looking at me. He was looking at me. Welcome to OCC. 
[15:31] OCC stands for Orsières–Champex–Chamonix.  So we start here in this beautiful Swiss  
[15:37] town of Orsières, and we make our way up to  Champex, another absolutely gorgeous town,  
[15:44] and then up and over, down to Argentière,  and then over La Flégère, down to Chamonix. 
[15:52] It’s 3,500 metres of elevation gain. It’s 55 or  so kilometres – probably going to be more than  
[15:59] that. We’re going to see how we go. Who knows?  Because it’s going to be very, very warm today. 
[16:21] Nice party atmosphere at the beginning. “One minute to go!” 
[16:40] And away we go. OCC 2024 is off and running. 
[17:08] As well as running, my big plan this year was to  follow Tom Evans and Jim Walmsley around the main  
[17:15] event. Having won the race the year before,  I knew Jim would be out to retain his title,  
[17:20] and Tom would be gunning to be champion – having  won CCC in 2018 and come third at UTMB in 2022. 
[17:30] I joined the crowds at the arch at 6  p.m. on Friday evening to watch what  
[17:35] is almost without question the most thrilling  start to a race you are ever likely to see. 
[17:41] For me though, it was all about the  battle between Jim and Tom, and I was  
[17:45] really excited to see how it would turn out. I would love you to hear the iconic UTMB music,  
[17:57] but copyright restrictions make that  impossible, unfortunately. Suffice to say,  
[18:02] the atmosphere was electric as 2,500  runners set off on their journey. For some,  
[18:08] it would take less than 20 hours. For  many, it would be double that – and more. 
[18:26] Back at the start of OCC, we were weaving  our way through the streets of Orsières  
[18:31] and already climbing when we came upon  the schoolchildren. This is something  
[18:37] Victoria had told me about from last year.  The children of the local schools line the  
[18:42] streets and cheer you out of town –  and you high-five them on the way. 
[18:55] And then we were well on our way to Champex-Lac. It didn’t take long for the sun to start doing  
[19:01] its thing. And because a lot of the  first few kilometres were on tarmac,  
[19:06] it was mostly runnable – so I  got very warm quite early on. 
[19:13] We continued to climb, mostly on tarmac,  and I imagined the elite runners up ahead  
[19:19] were absolutely caning this section. I loved  these early miles. The beauty of Switzerland  
[19:29] is remarkable. It’s so green and lush, and  the support passing through the various small  
[19:35] villages was amazing. I loved the oversized  cowbells some of the locals were ringing. 
[19:54] Aid station, then. Eventually we made it into  the forest, and from there it’s not too far to  
[20:03] climb to reach Champex-Lac. Even at this early  stage, I was glad of the shade, and with such  
[20:09] a mix of easy tarmac running and climbing,  it was important not to get carried away. 
[20:25] Seven kilometres: one hour, five minutes. We are just approaching Champex-Lac aid station. 
[20:39] "Basically just get water and go.  That’s what we need to do here." 
[20:46] Okay, water bottles full, as you can  see – I’ll push them down in a minute.  
[20:51] They’re wobbling about a bit, aren’t they? We’re going to make our way out now beside  
[20:54] this gorgeous lake at Champex. And I don’t think  I’ve ever done this in the light. Every time I’ve  
[21:01] come past this lake, it’s been in the dark –  so it’ll be nice to see it in the sunshine. 
[21:13] Nearly eight kilometres: one hour,  thirteen minutes. And this is Champex-Lac. 
[21:22] "Merci!" After running past the gorgeous lake  
[21:37] at Champex, there was some more very good running  downhill on the trails through the sunlit forests  
[21:44] to Plan de l’Au – at which point we started our  second climb of the day, up to Col de la Portalo. 
[22:00] Despite the increasing temperature, I was still  running and still relatively comfortable. I have  
[22:07] to say though, I’m starting to agree with people  who say they don’t like the Speedgoat 6s – they  
[22:12] are too firm underfoot and not very forgiving,  making for a rather hard and uninspiring ride. 
[22:25] Whilst I negotiate this climb, I would be  most grateful if you’d consider subscribing  
[22:29] to the channel. If ultras and stunning trail  running destinations are what you like to see,  
[22:35] we do that all the time on the Film My Run  channel, and we have plenty of films coming up  
[22:41] showcasing stunning and challenging routes. So click that notifications bell as well,  
[22:46] and make sure to watch to the end of  the video to see how this one turns out. 
[22:52] This is spectacular. So this is the climb  out of Champex-Lac that I have never seen  
[22:59] in the light. The only other time I’ve done  this climb is on CCC and UTMB – and both of  
[23:07] those times, it was in the dark. So it’s  nice to be able to see the view for once. 
[23:13] We are nearly 17 kilometres  in. Two hours, 50 minutes. 
[23:18] Quite a tough climb now, actually,  
[23:20] in the hot weather – and I think  it’s only going to get harder. 
[23:32] The atmosphere is crazy. We’re in Saint-Gervais  for the first checkpoint on the UTMB race. 
[23:43] Saint-Gervais is incredible on UTMB night. Even  when I’ve run through here as darkness is falling,  
[23:50] it’s still crowded and a cacophony of noise. I managed to run alongside both Tom and Jim  
[23:57] Walmsley for a few metres, and I’ll let you take  in the atmosphere as they run through the town. 
[24:42] At this point, runners are 20 kilometres into the  race and both Tom and Jim looked comfortable. Tom  
[24:49] was very focused; Jim was particularly  relaxed as they headed into the night. 
[25:10] "See you in the next one." So this is the top of the second  
[25:30] climb. The first climb was up to Champex-Lac,  second climb up to here – and then down to Trient. 
[25:39] "Good luck!" "Merci, thank you." 
[25:41] 17.7 kilometres. Three hours and four minutes. We got nothing else to do. The sun is peeking  
[25:53] through the cotton white lines. Your hands  still tangled up in mine. Feet on the wall,  
[26:05] your head on me. Water, usually. 
[26:09] So – 19 kilometres. Just leaving Les Jeurs. So down the hill to Trient. 
[26:20] And it’s getting hot now. It’s getting really hot. I can’t tell you how exciting it was to be running  
[26:29] these trails during daylight hours.  Despite the intense heat, I was loving  
[26:34] the experience – knowing I wasn’t going to be  running through the night and, dropping down  
[26:39] into the Trient Valley, I could finally see  the views I’d been missing all these years. 
[27:00] "Oh, it feels like that – like summer air through  window cracks. Oh, it feels like that – like the  
[27:04] summer sun on quiet drags. Oh, it feels like  that – like the summer rain that falls so slowly  
[27:18] on the naked skin upon your back. Oh, it  feels like that – like a love song on a  
[27:28] worn-out track. Yeah, it feels like that." That’s the famous pink church in Trient. 
[27:37] 23.5 kilometres. We’re just  coming up to four hours. 
[27:42] The small hamlet of Trient is a major waypoint  on the Tour du Mont Blanc. Still in Switzerland,  
[27:47] about four kilometres from the French border  as the crow flies. For runners and hikers,  
[27:52] the border is at Col de Balme – a high mountain  pass another couple of hours’ climb from Trient. 
[28:00] I’ve just dunked my face, head, and hat in some  water, and I am going to have a lot of Coca-Cola  
[28:06] now and give it five minutes, I think. We don’t  want to rush into this because I am really,  
[28:15] really going to struggle in this heat. Okay, we’re going to leave Trient. 
[28:24] So I’ve filled my water bottles up. I’ve had two  glasses of Coke, I’ve had two lots of watermelon,  
[28:31] and I’ve got some chocolate – which I’m going  to eat on the stroll out of the aid station. 
[28:38] Now we have a big climb up to Balme,  which is the highest point of the race. 
[28:42] I think it’s quite common for aid stations  to be in valleys at the foot of the next  
[28:48] big climb – but in this case, there is a good bit  of flat running before you start going up again.  
[28:55] It’s a long, exposed walk to the next climb. So this is Notre Dame de la Gorge. Tunnel set up  
[29:13] by HOKA. It’s absolutely fantastic to run through  – and hopefully we’ll catch Tom and Jim as they  
[29:20] come through this tunnel any minute now. “Hey Courtney.” “Hiya.” “Very well,  
[29:26] thank you.” “Are you feeling bad you’re not  running? Or are you glad you’re not running?” “Oh,  
[29:35] it’s so fun to be cheering. Super fun.” By now, Jim and Tom were in a pack running  
[29:48] together at the front of the race. Having just  left Les Contamines, they came through the HOKA  
[29:54] tunnel – and then it’s a right turn and up a  really long climb to one of the highest points  
[29:59] of the race at Col de la Croix du Bonhomme. This is one of the most iconic points on the  
[30:06] course, with crowds reaching fever pitch. It’s  reminiscent of scenes from the Tour de France. 
[30:47] Still no FOMO, Courtney? No FOMO?  “This is the best. I love it.” 
[31:15] Leaving Trient, we began what would be  a make-or-break climb for many in this  
[31:19] year’s OCC. It’s an absolutely beautiful  but punishing ascent to Col de Balme. 
[31:27] This climb coincided with the hottest  part of the day and many people began  
[31:32] to run out of water. There was an  extra water station about halfway up,  
[31:37] but there were huge queues and I didn’t want to  waste 20 minutes standing in a queue for water,  
[31:43] so I carried on with the minimal supplies I had. Initially, the route follows a river, which flows  
[31:51] from the 4.5-kilometre-long Trient Glacier – which  you can just see in the distance here behind me. 
[31:57] The route then turns away from the  river and becomes much steeper. 
[32:01] We are still on this grueling climb. I’ve  got about 150 metres to go to the top – so  
[32:10] not too far – but because of the heat,  it’s so draining. Just energy-sapping. 
[32:25] Last year, for some reason, the OCC route was  diverted and Victoria didn’t have to do this  
[32:30] section of the course. Great for her in one  sense, because I think this section is the  
[32:35] most difficult, but it did mean she missed out  on arguably the most spectacular view of all. 
[32:43] This fantastic ledge, with a sheer drop on  one side and chains embedded into the cliff  
[32:49] face to hold on to, is very exciting. Thankfully, once we tapped out at the  
[32:59] top of the climb, a few clouds began  rolling in, and because we were so high,  
[33:03] it did feel a little cooler. But many people  dropped out of the race around this point. 
[33:13] In the race against Victoria, I had  been ahead of her time from last year,  
[33:17] but now I was behind – and needed to catch up. “You can see Trient down there – you can spot  
[33:25] the pink church. That’s where we came from  about four hours ago. Seems a long time ago.” 
[33:34] Skirting the side of the mountain, it seemed to  take an absolute age to reach the aid station  
[33:39] at Col de Balme, where we finally crossed  the border from Switzerland into France. 
[33:45] “So – top of the climb. Col de  Balme. We’re not quite at the aid  
[33:50] station yet, but we’ve reached the top of  the climb there. Now we just have a couple  
[33:55] of hundred metres to get to the aid  station. I am really screwed. We’ve  
[34:05] just hit 34 kilometres in  seven hours and 16 minutes.” 
[34:11] "Thank you." "That was motivational." 
[34:31] "Good. Tell the camera how you're feeling." "I'm feeling happy that I saw Stephen Cousins." 
[34:44] "He's lying." "Herbert Krabel is going to finish this." 
[34:49] "Good job, Herbert." "Thank you." 
[35:07] Whilst most UTMB runners were just starting  their journey, many CCC 100km runners were  
[35:14] just finishing theirs. Late on Friday and into  Saturday, I spent some time watching a few cross  
[35:20] the line, including British ultrarunner Holly  Page, whose career we’ve followed with admiration. 
[35:27] She’d had a pretty rough time in the  mountains, but finished in a credible  
[35:31] 14 hours and 50 minutes, placing her 24th  female in the race. Holly runs for Adidas,  
[35:38] and her teammates were there to welcome her home.  We thought she might need medical attention,  
[35:44] but Holly wasn’t keen on that idea at all. “Guys, guys, guys, guys – I’ll be fine.  
[35:49] I’ll be fine.” “No, no, no, because they’ll  keep me forever.” “No, no – they love having  
[35:54] a look.” “No thanks.” “Can you tell me how  it went, quickly?” “Oh, very badly.” “Well,  
[36:01] you’ve not done too bad.” “I was fine for 70K.” The winner of CCC this year was Hayden Hawks,  
[36:10] who I managed to catch up with afterwards. “So Hayden, listen – tell me, after an incredible  
[36:18] year of injury last year, where you were really  low, talk to me about what this year has meant  
[36:23] to you now.” “Yeah, it’s meant a lot to me and  my family, you know. Having the hard year I had  
[36:30] last year – probably one of the hardest years  of my career, hardest years of my life – to be  
[36:34] able to come back and have such an incredible  year this year... it just proves to me that,  
[36:41] yeah, you kind of have to go through hard things  sometimes to come out stronger and better on the  
[36:46] other end. And yeah, that’s what I’ve been able to  do this year. It’s been an incredible journey. I  
[36:51] wouldn’t have had it any other way. I’m really  grateful I went through all that – and I’m a  
[36:56] better person, stronger person, because of it.” “I’m going to mislead you now, because you know  
[37:03] there are two big races out there that I know  you’d love to get to grips with. Where does  
[37:09] your priority lie – Western States or UTMB?” “I’m  still very much on the Western States train right  
[37:17] now. Western States is my goal. I’ve been second  and third there. I definitely want to get that  
[37:23] first place at Western States. That race suits me  – it suits my strengths better. I love the race,  
[37:30] the community, the area. So I’m definitely  going to go back to Western States next year  
[37:34] and focus on that. That’ll be my goal  for next year again. And then yeah,  
[37:39] we’ll see what happens. Everybody keeps asking  me when I’m going to do UTMB – and I said, I’ve  
[37:44] got to do Western States first, you know? After  that... yeah, I’d probably be keen on doing UTMB.” 
[37:50] Hayden Hawks – winner of CCC.  Absolutely fantastic. Bravo,  
[37:54] mate. Good job. Thank you so much. Overnight, there’d been carnage in  
[37:58] the main race, and both Tom Evans and  Jim Walmsley had unfortunately dropped,  
[38:03] leaving a new face at the front of the men’s race. Right – we’re at the bottom of the climb at  
[38:09] Vallorcine. The leader and the winner of UTMB,  young guy, new guy – Vincent Bouillard – is coming  
[38:16] down the hill. He’s got one more climb to do. Talking to Hayden Hawks, he was saying that  
[38:31] Vincent is well known amongst other runners, and  actually that he works in engineering for HOKA  
[38:37] themselves. But he was certainly a new name to me  – and I’m sure to many others following the event. 
[38:43] I ran with Vincent for a few hundred metres as  he made his way into Vallorcine. From here it’s  
[38:50] less than 20 kilometres and around 800 metres  of climbing and descent to the finish line.  
[39:15] He’s just got one climb left  to do – up to La Flégère,  
[39:18] and then down into Chamonix – and he’s going to  win UTMB unless something disastrous happens. 
[39:24] Amazing. Right – no point  
[39:31] messing around. Let’s just get down this hill. Twelve kilometres to Argentière. Herbert has  
[39:39] just told me he thinks it’s a smooth  descent – but I don’t know. We’ll see. 
[39:47] It’d be nice if it is a smooth descent,  because there’s been quite a lot of horrible,  
[39:51] gnarly rocks on that section over there. Didn’t  really enjoy it very much. But hopefully,  
[39:59] if this is a bit smoother, we can get a little  bit of running in over those twelve kilometres. 
[40:06] The cloud cover and the wind had significantly  cooled things down. The terrain was mostly smooth  
[40:13] and runnable, and I started to enjoy myself  more and more as we descended into Argentière. 
[40:20] It wasn’t all downhill, and the sun hadn’t  completely disappeared – but I was feeling a whole  
[40:25] lot better than I had been an hour or two earlier. I was blown away when I passed some Film My Run  
[40:51] fans from Mexico whilst descending  through Le Tour. How nice is that? 
[41:22] Okay – just coming into Argentière  now. So, one more climb to do. Up  
[41:27] to La Flégère and down into Chamonix. 44.8 kilometres. 9 hours, 1 minute. 
[41:35] So if I’m going to beat Victoria,  I’ve got to get up and over the climb  
[41:39] and down into Chamonix in 2 hours, 24 minutes. "Thank you!" "Thanks." Can I do that? Can I beat  
[41:48] Victoria’s time from last year? We’ll see. 
[42:07] I was in the crowd at the finish line of UTMB and  managed to grab a quick word with my friend Owen. 
[42:13] “Owen, how long have you been commentating  on UTMB races here?” “I think it was 2018 –  
[42:20] my first year here. Catherine Poletti saw me  working at the World Championships in… where  
[42:27] was it? In Spain – Penyagolosa. And Spain had a  great day that day. They were world champions,  
[42:32] so everybody was in great form. I had a great  time – smiling all day long. Catherine said to me,  
[42:37] ‘Owen, we want your smile in Chamonix. Come,  come.’ So I said yeah, sure, absolutely. 
[42:44] And to be honest, I’m from a cross-country  and track background. I ran for Ireland on  
[42:50] the mountains in the World  and European Championships,  
[42:52] but on the shorter courses – 10K, 11K.” “Don’t be modest – you’re quick!” 
[42:56] “No, so UTMB was never really on my radar.  When I came over here in those early years,  
[43:01] it was just… what a place. Thing is, to me,  you are the iconic voice of UTMB. What does  
[43:09] it mean to you to see these runners cross the  finish line, especially in a moment like this?” 
[43:15] “Stephen, to be honest, I hold back the tears  sometimes. And not even for the winners – it’s  
[43:19] for the guys coming home at the back end of  the field, when you see maybe their husband or  
[43:25] their wives or their kids, you know, who have  travelled from Hong Kong or the United States  
[43:30] or South Africa. And people are crying, and you  end up getting involved in that emotion as well. 
[43:36] Obviously, when you see the winners come across in  Chamonix, the whole town is rocking, and the eyes  
[43:43] of the world’s trail running media are all here.  It’s very special – but it’s right through, from  
[43:47] the start to the end. I know that sounds corny—” “No, no, you’re right.” 
[43:50] “—but it’s true, mate. It really  is. What’s happened is— it’s weird,  
[43:55] isn’t it? Everyone’s gone, haven’t  they? And someone’s taken their chance.” 
[43:59] “Well, I think it kind of happens the same  every year, doesn’t it? Like we say we’ll go  
[44:03] to bed around midnight—” “Yeah, yeah,  unless you’re out on the course – which  
[44:07] many people are – and then you wake up and it’s  all changed. And it’s all different, you know?” 
[44:12] “I was a little bit surprised when I saw Jim go  out so fast, because from what I’d heard and read,  
[44:16] he wasn’t 100%. A great fighter, but I wasn’t  massively surprised.” “No Tom either.” “No. I  
[44:25] had to look up the guy’s name – the French guy who  was winning. I hadn’t heard of him before.” “He’s  
[44:30] kind of new on the scene in the last year.” “Just  spoke to Hayden Hawks – he said he knows him well.  
[44:35] He’s obviously been around for about two years.  Works for HOKA – I think he’s an engineer – and  
[44:39] he’s been part of the HOKA team for four years.  But without a doubt, that’s four French winners  
[44:44] of the biggest race in ultrarunning in  the last few years.” “Better get back to  
[44:46] work.” “One more to come, mate. Cheers, Owen.” The finish line of UTMB is a special place for  
[44:56] any runner. But if you’re about to win UTMB,  and it’s the first major win of your career,  
[45:03] and you’re in front of a home  crowd – that must be incredible. 
[45:33] These are the moments you have  to treasure – with his family,  
[45:36] with his friends. He’s just run 100 miles in  less than 20 hours. The emotion is flowing. 
[45:43] You know, even I’ve got a tear in my eye. And I’d never heard of this guy before today.  
[45:50] He’s a local from Annecy, not far down  the road – and he’s just won the biggest  
[45:56] race in ultrarunning history. Amazing. A moment of a lifetime. 
[46:19] Then, only a short time later, American  runner Katie Schide crossed the line as  
[46:24] first female – for her second UTMB  crown, having won back in 2022. 
[46:48] I think what everyone wants to see – as  well as another Tom vs Jim race – is a Katie  
[46:54] Schide vs Courtney Dauwalter showdown. “Cheers, guys.”
[47:21] Five kilometres up to La Flégère. 670 metres  of climbing. We can do that, can’t we? 
[47:30] “Cheers, man. You okay? How’s it  going today?” “It’s been very hot.  
[47:37] Very hot. But I’m okay now – just  get this climb done and it’s fine.” 
[47:42] Leaving Argentière, I had just one climb left to  do. The climb up to La Flégère is quite technical,  
[47:50] and although I was feeling relaxed and  confident, I was moving very slowly by now. 
[47:56] All dead men walking now, I think. 9 hours 50 minutes. 47.58 km. About  
[48:07] 350 metres left of climbing up here. “Hi there. Is that for Film My Run,  
[48:17] man?” “Yeah.” “Funk me!” “Of all the  places to find you!” “It’s hard today,  
[48:22] huh? So hot.” “Yeah, yeah. It’s just hot. But,  you know, 350 metres to the top.” “Thanks a lot,  
[48:32] buddy. What’s your name?” “Alex.” “Thanks,  Alex. Nice to see you.” “Nice to meet you.” 
[48:44] We are so close to La Flégère – but it’s  just these last few metres of climb. 
[48:54] 10 hours, 27 minutes. Basically,  I’ve got an hour to beat Victoria. 
[48:59] By the time I reached the ski lifts, my legs  were shot. The heat wasn’t too much of an issue,  
[49:05] but I’d put in a big effort to get up  that last climb – and I was spent. Still,  
[49:10] I was determined to get down that hill  and into Chamonix as close to Victoria’s  
[49:16] time from last year as I possibly could. Right – we’re not stopping at the aid station.  
[49:27] No point. It’s just straight down the hill home. I remembered my CCC race from 2018 and how, after  
[49:38] 100 kilometres, I was still able to bomb down this  very hill, past over 100 runners, in 38 minutes.  
[49:47] It remains my fastest time on this descent. This year, I was able to run – just not quite  
[49:53] as fast as in 2018. It took me 49 minutes. About 3K to go, I think. 2K to the bottom  
[50:09] of the hill. 1K through the town. Going past the beautiful Floria  
[50:17] Café. Welcome, Stephen. “Yeah, I think  
[50:26] I’m okay. Stupid, innit? And about to go…” So that’s almost it now. We’ve  
[50:56] just dropped down into town. 56 kilometres on the watch. 11 hours, 32 minutes. 
[51:04] Don’t tell Victoria. It’s been hard work – but we are home. 
[51:11] As always, it was lovely to run through Chamonix,  with onlookers cheering and clapping, and friends  
[51:18] shouting my name and high-fiving as I ran past. It’s amazing how many hours of pain you can put  
[51:24] up with just for these few minutes of euphoria  at the end. I’ve loved this feeling since  
[51:30] my first time seven years ago – and I’m  not going to be sick of it anytime soon. 
[51:35] What a great finish line this always is. “Thank  
[51:57] you.” “Do you want to know my time?” “I’d  like to know your time.” “One hour,  
[52:07] 39 minutes. Did I say one hour?! Yeah... 11 hours,  39 minutes, 17 seconds.” “I didn’t beat Victoria.” 
[52:27] Right – this is Kristin, who I yo-yoed  with for the second half of the race.  
[52:31] She was really strong on the uphills and I  was a little bit stronger on the downhills. 
[52:35] “Is that your first time in Chamonix?” “It was  my first time in Chamonix. I mostly loved it.” 
[52:42] “And you say that two minutes after crossing  the line – so that’s pretty good.” “In a few  
[52:46] days I’ll be booking UTMB.” “Yeah. What’s your  plan for the next few years, then? Are you coming  
[52:54] back?” “I’m going to try road racing next year –  try to qualify for Boston. And then I’ll probably  
[53:00] yo-yo back to trail.” “Why not try it all?” “Kristen, thank you so much.” “Yeah, thank you.” 
[53:06] “I’m just filming you saying that you let me  down by not coming to the finish line.” “I  
[53:09] let you down, man. Sorry. I was there ahead  of you every day on Cape Wrath. And here I am.” 
[53:16] “Did we tell you that we’ve done Cape Wrath?  Did Jay tell you that he’s done Cape Wrath?” 
[53:23] The final act of this year’s  race was to pick up my gilet,  
[53:26] which is what you get at the end of UTMB  instead of a medal – and to wallow in that  
[53:31] sense of satisfaction that comes with a job  well done, even if I didn’t beat my wife. 
[53:37] If you’ve been inspired watching this video, I  really hope to see you out in Chamonix one day. 
[53:43] And maybe – you never know – I may  see you on the start line next time.
