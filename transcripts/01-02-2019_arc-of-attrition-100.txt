TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

I've done the arc of attrition three times now the first time I did it I took my camera with me on the run most of you hopefully most of you will have seen that film I know you all want me to take the camera with me on the run and make another film like I did two years ago and I will do that again it may be next year it may be the year after we'll just have to see but this year I did the same thing again as last year I gave the camera to my children this year though I think they did a little bit of a better job of keeping filming during the whole race so we have got most of the checkpoints in this time so let's start the very beginning and the very beginning is well before the race starts honestly has there ever been a race where so many people have had so much trouble just getting to the start line it was incredible we got caught in a snow drift on the a38 heading down just out of Exeter but we didn't get caught in the main blockage that happened at the top of Bodmin Moor on the 8th 30 I know so many people got caught in that my friend Richard got coin he was there all night didn't make the race and I know from a hundred ninety-two entries to the Ark of attrition one hundred and ninety something entries to the Ark of attrition there were 30 odd people who didn't even make it to the start line because of the snow we made it to our hotel in camp born later evening managed to get a decent amount of sleep and we were up for breakfast in the morning and then we got in the car and made our way down to registration on our way to register for the ark 2009 it's been an absolutely terrible terrible night okay here in snow some people are not even gonna make it to the start line because they've been stuck all died in the snow we luckily made it so we're on our way to the Eco Park to register there is a brand new race HQ for the Ark of attrition it's at the ecological park which is still in port town but just a little bit out of the main beach area it just means there's a lot more room for people to mill about there's a nice coffee area there's a lot more parking that means that that poor blue bar in Port Allen isn't absolutely swamped every year by 200 people this guys won this race as usual the start of the arc of attrition 100 mile race is at khovrakh small village on the south coast of Cornwall so we all get on buses it is mandatory to get on the buses because they can't have hundreds of cars arriving at that tiny village get on the bus to get to the start line we won't film a star I'm not taking the camera with me the kids are going to do the filming again really much cause the night in ten miles at whatever it whatever it's called - it points because the camera was now with my wife and kids there's no film of the start of the race I'm not gonna use anybody elses footage of the start but suffice to say it was a little bit different than usual and we started a bit further up near at the car park usually we start kind of right on the seafront it was a big banging drum at the beginning and Andy the race director introduced all the elite runners to us so it's a bit more of a razzmatazz kind of affair and then when the gun went off we we all ran down the hill flanked by these blue flares held up by the race marshals so it's quite an event to start the race the race started at midday so I spent the next two and a half hours running along the coast to lizard point which was the first point at which I met my family it is gnarly from the very beginning there is no messing about with this race once you're out of coverage you are straight on to the gnarly difficult terrain yes first meeting point if this was further in the race you would say it was really really tough terrain to get over as you're just beginning it's not quite so bad but running fairly steadily fairly conservatively just to preserve my energy for later in the race it took me two and a half hours to get from Cobb rack and starts to which is just over ten miles into the race the next meeting point is a pretty little fishing village called mullion cove and the running between lizard point and mullion cove is chief justice stuff quite muddy on this occasion very windy although the Sun was out it wasn't overly cold it was still quite difficult running and I think I lost a little bit time [Music] as you can see he's in the front [Music] you're closing the gap at 18 miles which is the last year there was a massive coastal path diversion just before 11 which added an extra two miles and half an hour to our journey this year that wasn't there there is a new coast path section much easier to run on and actually that running between mullion cove and port levin is much nicer but this is the time that the Sun starts to go down the idea for me really the idea is to get to Portland before it gets dark okay so this is the first checkpoint spawn every 25 miles all right I'm ready for this checkpoint though no I think I just might in Korea with me out so after the it's a relatively short journey so the next checkpoint at Penzance there's a little stopped halfway through at Perrineau flow where I briefly see my wife get quick drink and but generally actually it's quite flat running and when you get to the excellence of Penzance are you covering four five miles of flat lit tarmac Road all the way into Penzance and out of Penzance I can't like it in a way because it breaks up the 100 miles you've got the initial gnarly cliff section from the Stars into Penzance and then you've got this town which kind of breaks up the whole 100 miles from just before halfway and then you kind of get back on to the old gnarly cliffs again so Penzance is around about 38 miles depends how many diversions you've dug depends how often you've gone wrong and off the trail yeah that's a really flat bit for about 4 months 3 miles along the sea from there and you feel like you've got to run at all so I did run it all so I'm quite tired now I need a rest but this is a good milestone to get to Penn's answer you get out of here get to Lands End you're doing good so now we come to the section of the race where there is a little bit of a lack of footage partly my fault parley my wife's fault so you leave Penzance it's nice and flat he's still on the road and then eventually leaving Penzance up onto the hills again and on till the morning ov I thought well wasn't it point in filming laborda Cove it's quick through we're out of there in a second it's dark let's just get on with it so we went through the Borna Cove and onto the next stop which is Minich theater if you were at Minik theater on Saturday morning for the start of the 50 you'll know what it looks like absolutely beautiful part the coast a kind of amphitheater built into the rocks so you can what play and look out over the sea whilst you watching it beautiful at the summer time probably not so great in the winter so we didn't film that Minich theater either I thought we'd wait till we get to Lands End there we can go inside it's nice warm it's light we can do some filming have a catch-up everything will be fine so a few wrong turns lots of mud lots of climbing up steps a fair bit of rubbing and I made it to Lands End slightly ahead of schedule something like two o'clock in the morning anyway I got to Lands End and my wife wasn't there or at least I couldn't find it she says she was there in the carpark I don't believe her I don't believe her anyway she wasn't there I had to rush I didn't want to spend too long had a quick bowl of soup chicken soup very nice thank you very much looked after very well by the archangels as always and on I went Lands End to Kate Cornwall last year had a navigational error where I managed to come back on myself I made sure that I followed my watch and I didn't make that same navigational error again and there's also a navigational error a lot of people make the mistake of missing a turn going downhill into sin and Cove a lot of people end up on a road and wonder where on earth they are it's just a case of making sure you look at your map or making sure the GPS track on your watch is correct so that when you look at it you know you're going in the right direction look it's a self navigation event and sometimes stuff happens that you just can't predict yes in theory keep the C on your left and everything's fine but obviously it really isn't like that there are there are places where if you turn left you'll go to a headland and it'll be a dead-end and there's nowhere else to go or you turn right and you'll go all the way inland and I'll tell you about that in a minute so there are mistakes you can make one thing you must not do is simply follow the person influence I've learned that to my cost plenty of times unless unless you know and they know exactly where they're going and you trust them don't just blindly follow the person ahead last year we went off into a field somewhere because we all followed somebody the year before that I went into brambles because I'd followed somebody just blindly not taking any notice of where I was going just watching the person in front just don't do that be confident in your own navigational ability it might go wrong but at least you're the one to blame and not somebody else after sin and Cove and onto Cape Cornwall is some of the best terrain honestly you you absolutely love it it is boulders and stuff you've got to climb over and sometimes you don't know where the path is and you're wondering if there's a massive cliff drop to your left and there probably is it's really really good anyway my head torch died at this point so in the pitch-black I had to try and change the battery in my head torch managed to do that eventually and managed to get to Kate Cornwall where my wife cleaned my feet and I was feeling a little bit worse for wear you'll also notice how tired I am here I say sir Ives when I mean Lands End so you can see I am getting tired mental focus is not quite what it was earlier on the race this is what happens we had a slight mishap at some eyes I arrived far too quickly and Victoria hadn't got there yet and I just missed her apparently so here we are at Cape Cornwall it is about 10:00 to 4:00 in the morning five to four in the morning and I'm just having my feet clean I'm still really wrecked now so yeah we're now well we've done 102 kilometers 60 62 miles 60 something miles I don't know I like I feel like I'm gonna be sick in a minute yeah maybe so I've got to get to Penn Dean watch lighthouse in five miles and then there's a 13-mile slog over really of a really rough terrain to get to Sinai's but once Ritz and Ives have a nice rest there and hopefully it will be an easy 20 mile jog home from Cape Cornwall it's a short hop and I was fairly conscious of time here so I really didn't want to spend too long at the checkpoints at the meeting points with my wife I've had a little bit of time at Cape Cornwall where she'd washed my feet and change my socks and things like that so you can see here I don't want to spend too long having tea and things like that no I'm good I'll just go yeah I'm just gonna go ask you if you want no is it right there yeah okay go go for it okay it's quarter past 5:00 in the morning we are appending watch lighthouse so now 13 miles 21 kilometers with no help until we get to st. Ives so I'm hoping to get sent Ives by at least half 10 no that is great loads of people are coming to our rescue because our boiler is not lighting you right now this yeah good lad else are you okay crew we're doing really well you are unlikely to run in the UK on any terrain tougher than this section between pending watch lighthouse and certain Ives add to that the fact that it is mostly in the dark and add to that the unbelievable weather that then started to appear the wind had been blowing a gale most of the night we then had rain but we also then had sideways hailstones and these with this is not just tiny houses these were marble sized hail stones for a good 10 15 minutes on and off for a good period during that whole section so you're you're running about you're not really running you are making your way over rocky muddy slippy difficult terrain in the dark with hailstones sideways hitting you in the face as you go this is not easy running guys seriously and stuff goes wrong and stuff went wrong for me I was not paying attention so I got about halfway into this run it was starting to get light but my mental focus was going I wasn't looking at my watch I climbed up a hill then I looked at my watch and I knew I was off track now rather than do the sensible thing of going back down the hill and rejoining the path I thought no surely there's a way just to get back onto the coast bar if I might just carry on this and just go round I'll just get back onto the coast puff oh no oh no I just kept going and kept going no path on the left no path from the left to get back on the more I went the harder it was to make the decision to turn around and go back and backtrack back to the coast path from where I came so I just carried on going going eventually there was a path off to the left and normal public footpath through some farmer's fields which took me into the village of Z naught itself where I asked somebody in a car park how do I get back to the coast path and it was literally another mile along a road before I could rejoin the coast path I think I added half an hour and two miles to my journey which really annoyed me at the time but these things happen and if you're not again as I said earlier if you're not paying attention if you've not got your eye on your GPS tracker on your map if you're not paying attention to the acorn signs that are on I mean this you know it shouldn't be hard there are a con signs on posts that you can look at and they tell you where to go and it says coast path with an arrow for goodness sake when you're tired these things just don't happen and I went off and I guess I added two miles to my journal but there we are it got light and eventually made it over the boulder climb more Boulder climbing again lots of fun I mean it is terrific you know you are tired but this is what you're there for it's absolutely fabulous it's a hard hard work you cannot really run very fast on this terrain but it's just enjoyable it's like Dan Lawson who came second in the 50 mile race he said it's like playing it's like dancing through the puddles and over the rocks that's what it's like it's just it's a game but it really is such a relief to get to Sinai's thank you to the valets the arc of attrition who meet you just before the checkpoint and run you in to the checkpoints every checkpoint there are valets that do that thank you to Melissa it was my valet who ran me into survives where I can dress you can see here that I'm tired I actually say it's taken me ten and a half hours to get here what I mean by that is it's half-past 10:00 in the morning not that it's sick ten hours it's actually take me 22 and a half hours to get there okay so finally arrived it's a knives that was hard work that sideways hailed some of the time rain a lot of the time really howling gale for a lot of it and most of that in the dark but we are here now so I've arrived here in ten hours and twenty minutes which means as long as I leave here in the next half an hour which will get under thirty hours for the whole run we've travelled 132 kilometers to steep tarmac sections getting out of sin Ives itself but then it's flat rolling all the way around the bay into hail I sometimes briefly say hello to my wife there and grab a quick drink and then it's on to the dunes of do the dunes of doing when I first did it were not wait marked so the staff at art of attrition put glow sticks through so you could find your way through now they've been replaced by big slabs of stone marking every two three hundred meters through the dunes and as long as you keep your eyes out for those markers then you will find your way through the dunes fairly easy I don't relish the idea of doing it in the dark though as the arc fifty runners had to do so the next section you see me arrive at after the dunes of do is Godrevy Godrevy is around about eleven we've got the beach you go past health which is a well-known tourist spot and all the way along to port wreath compared to what's gone before it is relatively easy running it's fairly flat most of the way apart from a little sting just before you get into the truth when there's two down and ups one little nod you go down and you go from steps and then another big valley you all I don't need his family all the way back up again absolutely kills you with six months to go that really hurts but finally you drop down it okay in under 29 hours hopefully so obviously by now I knew I was going to get well as long as nothing disastrous happened I knew I was gonna get under 30 hours and if I continue to run relatively well I would get a PB but I was really shattered by now and I hadn't been going the speed that I'd really wanted to go from sir Ives all the way to Patrice I've been really quite slow and it was a bit disappointed in my speed over that terrain so I did pick it up a little bit I've just tried to run in the last four miles five miles from the tree into Port Allen and there's a different finish now to the ARCA patrician they used to end at the blue bar on the beach at Port Allen now you have to run down the hill all the way out of Port Allen and then got another Hill to the finish so it adds another mile onto the run at this point I was on for finish of 28 hours and 30 minutes I wanted to just try and sneak under 28 30 so I was pretty pushing it to try and do that [Applause] okay excuse me I've finished know what screw doesn't get those tears at the end recognize will understand hundred miles is a long way 100 miles with much of its almost half of it in the dark is harder still given the terrain given the weather that we had it is an absolute relief to cross the finish line it's a relief that you've crossed it in the first place that you haven't been injured you'll fall into your death down a cliff you haven't had to pull out because you've been sick because you fainted because but for any number of reasons you might DNF a race like that there's a massive outpouring of emotion that happens at that moment that you cross the finish line you're just so incredibly grateful and have been relieved to cross that finish line without any disasters happening that's what those tears are about but and they're also an immense sense of satisfaction and pride and achievement and it's a great it is a great feeling it's a it's a feeling that you don't get very often in life and those those tears are absolutely not embarrassing to me at all it's just something that I do when I've you know it's not doesn't happen every race doesn't happen every race but it happens on those races where I've really been through the ringer and it's really meant a lot to get to that finish line great job but at you I had nothing for that last 20 miles you too flew away brilliant job really good well done you well fastest time 28 and a half just our villains because that bloody hero yeah [Music] but yeah I mean I had a little clown for 27 hours that I thought I probably have not trained up enough for that time and Troon if I wasn't but I went out I went out with that in mind and I got to the last twenty one side left sand ice I had nothing left and there was a lot of struggling this is Laura by the way Laura won today she's and now she how long have you been there since you finished are you just yeah Thank You Laura so we are at the ecological park which is the new finish of the our competition the 100 mile race 104 106 because if you go the wrong way you had plenty of miles but once again we finished once again we've got gold buckle so we can't be anything but happy with that and I'm going to drink coffee and have a long long bath so the next morning we all gathered back at the ecological park for the prize-giving massive congratulations to Kim Karlsen who managed to come in in a new course record time and here is so this is Kim was the winner they are 100 this year did you do it I mean it's a hard old gnarly courses today enjoy but it's not really like that first section of a life like they are before tonight's just drain the photo face did you enjoy the winter don't do that 4 o'clock in the morning horizontal hailstones it's not like often at today thank you very much Kim the winner of the arc 100 2019 in a time I'm really sorry it's not a course record which is the first thing you said to me we cross the line in 26 hours 48 the winner of the 2019 arc 100 in a fantastic time and a new course record of 20 hours 43 minutes of 46 seconds representing team red light is Kip Hollinger [Music] so the finish line's been taken down we're all going home as a beautiful sunny morning here in port town and that is it for the arc 100 and the arc 50 as well but an absolutely amazing time managed to get a PB 28 hours 31 minutes 39 seconds something like that approximately around about that might be a bit quicker for I hadn't gone off to zen all and added an extra miles my journey but that is the way it is with the arc it's just an adventure if you have even the slightest inkling that you might like to try it you've got to sign up really the arc is an amazing event so that's it to do subscribe to the film our own YouTube channel I will see you again for another adventure another old trend of the mouth and next time take care of

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

[00:06] I've done the arc of attrition three
[00:09] times now the first time I did it I took
[00:12] my camera with me on the run most of you
[00:16] hopefully most of you will have seen
[00:18] that film I know you all want me to take
[00:21] the camera with me on the run and make
[00:23] another film like I did two years ago
[00:25] and I will do that again
[00:27] it may be next year it may be the year
[00:29] after we'll just have to see but this
[00:31] year I did the same thing again as last
[00:33] year I gave the camera to my children
[00:36] this year though I think they did a
[00:37] little bit of a better job of keeping
[00:39] filming during the whole race so we have
[00:43] got most of the checkpoints in this time
[00:46] so let's start the very beginning and
[00:48] the very beginning is well before the
[00:51] race starts honestly has there ever been
[00:53] a race where so many people have had so
[00:56] much trouble just getting to the start
[00:58] line it was incredible
[01:00] we got caught in a snow drift on the a38
[01:05] heading down just out of Exeter but we
[01:08] didn't get caught in the main blockage
[01:10] that happened at the top of Bodmin Moor
[01:11] on the 8th 30 I know so many people got
[01:15] caught in that my friend Richard got
[01:17] coin he was there all night didn't make
[01:20] the race and I know from a hundred
[01:23] ninety-two entries to the Ark of
[01:25] attrition one hundred and ninety
[01:27] something entries to the Ark of
[01:28] attrition there were 30 odd people who
[01:31] didn't even make it to the start line
[01:33] because of the snow we made it to our
[01:36] hotel in camp born later evening managed
[01:38] to get a decent amount of sleep and we
[01:40] were up for breakfast in the morning and
[01:43] then we got in the car and made our way
[01:45] down to registration on our way to
[01:49] register for the ark 2009
[01:53] it's been an absolutely terrible
[01:56] terrible night okay here in snow some
[02:01] people are not even gonna make it to the
[02:02] start line because they've been stuck
[02:04] all died in the snow we luckily made it
[02:06] so we're on our way to the Eco Park to
[02:10] register there is a brand new race HQ
[02:13] for the Ark of attrition it's at the
[02:15] ecological park which is still in port
[02:18] town but just a little bit out of the
[02:20] main beach area it just means there's a
[02:22] lot more room for people to mill about
[02:24] there's a nice coffee area there's a lot
[02:26] more parking that means that that poor
[02:28] blue bar in Port Allen isn't absolutely
[02:32] swamped every year by 200 people this
[02:37] guys won this race as usual the start of
[02:43] the arc of attrition 100 mile race is at
[02:46] khovrakh small village on the south
[02:47] coast of Cornwall so we all get on buses
[02:50] it is mandatory to get on the buses
[02:52] because they can't have hundreds of cars
[02:53] arriving at that tiny village get on the
[03:01] bus to get to the start line
[03:02] we won't film a star I'm not taking the
[03:04] camera with me the kids are going to do
[03:06] the filming again really much cause the
[03:12] night
[03:15] in ten miles at whatever it whatever
[03:18] it's called - it points because the
[03:24] camera was now with my wife and kids
[03:26] there's no film of the start of the race
[03:30] I'm not gonna use anybody elses footage
[03:32] of the start but suffice to say it was a
[03:35] little bit different than usual and we
[03:37] started a bit further up near at the car
[03:39] park usually we start kind of right on
[03:42] the seafront it was a big banging drum
[03:44] at the beginning and Andy the race
[03:46] director introduced all the elite
[03:48] runners to us so it's a bit more of a
[03:51] razzmatazz kind of affair and then when
[03:54] the gun went off we we all ran down the
[03:56] hill flanked by these blue flares held
[04:00] up by the race marshals so it's quite an
[04:03] event to start the race the race started
[04:06] at midday so I spent the next two and a
[04:09] half hours running along the coast to
[04:11] lizard point which was the first point
[04:13] at which I met my family it is gnarly
[04:16] from the very beginning there is no
[04:18] messing about with this race once you're
[04:20] out of coverage you are straight on to
[04:23] the gnarly difficult terrain yes first
[04:28] meeting point
[04:30] if this was further in the race you
[04:32] would say it was really really tough
[04:34] terrain to get over as you're just
[04:36] beginning it's not quite so bad but
[04:39] running fairly steadily fairly
[04:41] conservatively just to preserve my
[04:43] energy for later in the race it took me
[04:45] two and a half hours to get from Cobb
[04:47] rack and starts to which is just over
[04:50] ten miles into the race the next meeting
[05:28] point is a pretty little fishing village
[05:30] called mullion cove and the running
[05:32] between lizard point and mullion cove is
[05:34] chief justice stuff quite muddy on this
[05:38] occasion very windy although the Sun was
[05:41] out it wasn't overly cold it was still
[05:43] quite difficult running and I think I
[05:45] lost a little bit time
[05:48] [Music]
[05:53] as you can see he's in the front
[06:02] [Music]
[06:12] you're closing the gap at 18 miles which
[06:29] is the last year there was a massive
[06:57] coastal path diversion just before 11
[07:00] which added an extra two miles and half
[07:03] an hour to our journey this year that
[07:05] wasn't there there is a new coast path
[07:07] section much easier to run on and
[07:09] actually that running between
[07:11] mullion cove and port levin is much
[07:14] nicer but this is the time that the Sun
[07:16] starts to go down the idea for me really
[07:19] the idea is to get to Portland before it
[07:21] gets dark
[07:33] okay so this is the first checkpoint
[07:35] spawn every 25 miles all right I'm ready
[07:41] for this checkpoint though no I think I
[07:49] just might in Korea with me out so after
[07:53] the it's a relatively short journey so
[07:57] the next checkpoint at Penzance there's
[07:59] a little stopped halfway through at
[08:01] Perrineau flow where I briefly see my
[08:03] wife get quick drink and but generally
[08:05] actually it's quite flat running and
[08:07] when you get to the excellence of
[08:09] Penzance are you covering four five
[08:12] miles of flat lit tarmac Road all the
[08:16] way into Penzance and out of Penzance I
[08:18] can't like it in a way because it breaks
[08:21] up the 100 miles
[08:22] you've got the initial gnarly cliff
[08:25] section from the Stars into Penzance and
[08:28] then you've got this town which kind of
[08:30] breaks up the whole 100 miles from just
[08:33] before halfway and then you kind of get
[08:35] back on to the old gnarly cliffs again
[08:37] so Penzance is around about 38 miles
[08:41] depends how many diversions you've dug
[08:43] depends how often you've gone wrong and
[08:45] off the trail yeah that's a really flat
[08:47] bit for about 4 months 3 miles along the
[08:50] sea from there and you feel like you've
[08:53] got to run at all so I did run it all so
[08:55] I'm quite tired now I need a rest
[08:56] but this is a good milestone to get to
[08:59] Penn's answer you get out of here get to
[09:02] Lands End
[09:03] you're doing good so now we come to the
[09:05] section of the race where there is a
[09:06] little bit of a lack of footage partly
[09:09] my fault
[09:10] parley my wife's fault so you leave
[09:12] Penzance it's nice and flat he's still
[09:15] on the road and then eventually leaving
[09:17] Penzance up onto the hills again and on
[09:19] till the morning ov I thought well
[09:21] wasn't it point in filming laborda Cove
[09:23] it's quick through we're out of there in
[09:25] a second it's dark let's just get on
[09:27] with it so we went through the Borna
[09:28] Cove and onto the next stop which is
[09:31] Minich theater if you were at Minik
[09:33] theater on Saturday morning for the
[09:35] start of the 50 you'll know what it
[09:36] looks like absolutely beautiful part the
[09:38] coast a kind of amphitheater built into
[09:42] the rocks so you can what
[09:44] play and look out over the sea whilst
[09:46] you watching it beautiful at the summer
[09:47] time
[09:48] probably not so great in the winter so
[09:51] we didn't film that Minich theater
[09:53] either
[09:53] I thought we'd wait till we get to Lands
[09:55] End there we can go inside it's nice
[09:57] warm it's light we can do some filming
[10:00] have a catch-up everything will be fine
[10:02] so a few wrong turns lots of mud lots of
[10:06] climbing up steps a fair bit of rubbing
[10:08] and I made it to Lands End
[10:11] slightly ahead of schedule something
[10:13] like two o'clock in the morning anyway I
[10:16] got to Lands End and my wife wasn't
[10:19] there or at least I couldn't find it she
[10:21] says she was there in the carpark I
[10:23] don't believe her I don't believe her
[10:26] anyway
[10:27] she wasn't there I had to rush I didn't
[10:30] want to spend too long had a quick bowl
[10:32] of soup chicken soup very nice thank you
[10:34] very much looked after very well by the
[10:36] archangels as always and on I went Lands
[10:39] End to Kate Cornwall last year had a
[10:43] navigational error where I managed to
[10:44] come back on myself I made sure that I
[10:47] followed my watch and I didn't make that
[10:48] same navigational error again and
[10:50] there's also a navigational error a lot
[10:53] of people make the mistake of missing a
[10:54] turn going downhill into sin and Cove a
[10:57] lot of people end up on a road and
[10:59] wonder where on earth they are it's just
[11:02] a case of making sure you look at your
[11:04] map or making sure the GPS track on your
[11:07] watch is correct so that when you look
[11:09] at it you know you're going in the right
[11:10] direction look it's a self navigation
[11:14] event and sometimes stuff happens that
[11:16] you just can't predict yes in theory
[11:19] keep the C on your left and everything's
[11:21] fine but obviously it really isn't like
[11:23] that there are there are places where if
[11:26] you turn left you'll go to a headland
[11:28] and it'll be a dead-end and there's
[11:30] nowhere else to go or you turn right and
[11:32] you'll go all the way inland and I'll
[11:34] tell you about that in a minute so there
[11:37] are mistakes you can make one thing you
[11:39] must not do is
[11:41] simply follow the person influence I've
[11:42] learned that to my cost plenty of times
[11:44] unless unless you know and they know
[11:48] exactly where they're going and you
[11:50] trust them don't just blindly follow the
[11:53] person ahead last year we went off into
[11:55] a field somewhere because we all
[11:57] followed somebody the year before that I
[11:59] went into brambles because I'd followed
[12:01] somebody just blindly not taking any
[12:04] notice of where I was going just
[12:05] watching the person in front just don't
[12:08] do that be confident in your own
[12:09] navigational ability it might go wrong
[12:12] but at least you're the one to blame and
[12:14] not somebody else after sin and Cove and
[12:16] onto Cape Cornwall is some of the best
[12:19] terrain honestly you you absolutely love
[12:21] it it is boulders and stuff you've got
[12:24] to climb over and sometimes you don't
[12:26] know where the path is and you're
[12:28] wondering if there's a massive cliff
[12:29] drop to your left and there probably is
[12:31] it's really really good
[12:34] anyway my head torch died at this point
[12:37] so in the pitch-black I had to try and
[12:40] change the battery in my head torch
[12:42] managed to do that eventually and
[12:44] managed to get to Kate Cornwall where my
[12:46] wife cleaned my feet and I was feeling a
[12:48] little bit worse for wear you'll also
[12:51] notice how tired I am here I say sir
[12:54] Ives when I mean Lands End so you can
[12:57] see I am getting tired mental focus is
[13:01] not quite what it was earlier on the
[13:03] race this is what happens
[13:05] we had a slight mishap at some eyes I
[13:10] arrived far too quickly and Victoria
[13:13] hadn't got there yet and I just missed
[13:17] her apparently so here we are at Cape
[13:21] Cornwall it is about 10:00 to 4:00 in
[13:26] the morning
[13:28] five to four in the morning and I'm just
[13:33] having my feet clean I'm still really
[13:36] wrecked now so yeah
[13:38] we're now well we've done 102 kilometers
[13:45] 60 62 miles 60 something miles I don't
[13:51] know I like I feel like I'm gonna be
[13:53] sick in a minute yeah maybe so I've got
[14:00] to get to Penn Dean watch lighthouse in
[14:02] five miles and then there's a 13-mile
[14:04] slog over really of a really rough
[14:08] terrain to get to Sinai's but once Ritz
[14:11] and Ives have a nice rest there and
[14:13] hopefully it will be an easy 20 mile jog
[14:16] home from Cape Cornwall it's a short hop
[14:22] and I was fairly conscious of time here
[14:26] so I really didn't want to spend too
[14:28] long at the checkpoints at the meeting
[14:32] points with my wife I've had a little
[14:34] bit of time at Cape Cornwall where she'd
[14:36] washed my feet and change my socks and
[14:38] things like that so you can see here I
[14:41] don't want to spend too long having tea
[14:45] and things like that
[14:47] no I'm good I'll just go yeah I'm just
[14:50] gonna go ask you if you want
[14:52] no is it right there yeah okay go go for
[14:57] it
[15:02] okay it's quarter past 5:00 in the
[15:05] morning we are appending watch
[15:07] lighthouse so now 13 miles 21 kilometers
[15:11] with no help until we get to st. Ives so
[15:17] I'm hoping to get sent Ives by at least
[15:19] half 10 no that is great loads of people
[15:26] are coming to our rescue because our
[15:28] boiler is not lighting you right now
[15:32] this yeah good lad else are you okay
[15:38] crew we're doing really well you are
[15:41] unlikely to run in the UK on any terrain
[15:45] tougher than this section between
[15:48] pending watch lighthouse and certain
[15:50] Ives
[15:50] add to that the fact that it is mostly
[15:52] in the dark and add to that the
[15:55] unbelievable weather that then started
[15:57] to appear the wind had been blowing a
[16:01] gale most of the night we then had rain
[16:05] but we also then had sideways hailstones
[16:09] and these with this is not just tiny
[16:11] houses these were marble sized hail
[16:14] stones for a good 10 15 minutes on and
[16:17] off for a good period during that whole
[16:20] section so you're you're running about
[16:22] you're not really running you are making
[16:24] your way over rocky muddy slippy
[16:27] difficult terrain in the dark with
[16:30] hailstones sideways hitting you in the
[16:32] face as you go this is not easy running
[16:35] guys seriously and stuff goes wrong and
[16:38] stuff went wrong for me I was not paying
[16:40] attention so I got about halfway into
[16:44] this run it was starting to get light
[16:47] but my mental focus was going I wasn't
[16:50] looking at my watch I climbed up a hill
[16:52] then I looked at my watch and I knew I
[16:55] was off track now rather than do the
[16:58] sensible thing of going back down the
[17:00] hill and rejoining the path I thought no
[17:03] surely there's a way just to get back
[17:05] onto the coast bar if I might just carry
[17:07] on this
[17:08] and just go round I'll just get back
[17:09] onto the coast puff oh no oh no I just
[17:13] kept going and kept going no path on the
[17:15] left no path from the left to get back
[17:17] on the more I went the harder it was to
[17:20] make the decision to turn around and go
[17:21] back and backtrack back to the coast
[17:23] path from where I came so I just carried
[17:25] on going going eventually there was a
[17:28] path off to the left and normal public
[17:29] footpath through some farmer's fields
[17:32] which took me into the village of Z
[17:34] naught itself where I asked somebody in
[17:36] a car park how do I get back to the
[17:38] coast path and it was literally another
[17:40] mile along a road before I could rejoin
[17:43] the coast path I think I added half an
[17:46] hour and two miles to my journey which
[17:49] really annoyed me at the time but these
[17:53] things happen and if you're not again as
[17:56] I said earlier if you're not paying
[17:57] attention if you've not got your eye on
[17:59] your GPS tracker on your map if you're
[18:02] not paying attention to the acorn signs
[18:04] that are on I mean this you know it
[18:07] shouldn't be hard there are a con signs
[18:09] on posts that you can look at and they
[18:12] tell you where to go and it says coast
[18:14] path with an arrow for goodness sake
[18:16] when you're tired these things just
[18:19] don't happen and I went off and I guess
[18:23] I added two miles to my journal but
[18:26] there we are
[18:27] it got light and eventually made it over
[18:31] the boulder climb more Boulder climbing
[18:34] again lots of fun I mean it is terrific
[18:36] you know you are tired but this is what
[18:39] you're there for it's absolutely
[18:40] fabulous it's a hard hard work you
[18:43] cannot really run very fast on this
[18:46] terrain but it's just enjoyable it's
[18:48] like Dan Lawson who came second in the
[18:50] 50 mile race he said it's like playing
[18:52] it's like dancing through the puddles
[18:54] and over the rocks that's what it's like
[18:56] it's just it's a game but it really is
[18:59] such a relief to get to Sinai's thank
[19:03] you to the valets the arc of attrition
[19:06] who meet you just before the checkpoint
[19:09] and run you in to the checkpoints every
[19:11] checkpoint there are valets that do that
[19:13] thank you to Melissa
[19:14] it was my valet who ran me into survives
[19:16] where I can dress you can see here that
[19:19] I'm tired I actually say it's taken me
[19:22] ten and a half hours to get here what I
[19:25] mean by that is it's half-past 10:00 in
[19:27] the morning not that it's sick ten hours
[19:29] it's actually take me 22 and a half
[19:31] hours to get there okay so finally
[19:34] arrived it's a knives that was hard work
[19:36] that sideways hailed some of the time
[19:40] rain a lot of the time really howling
[19:43] gale for a lot of it and most of that in
[19:48] the dark but we are here now so I've
[19:54] arrived here in ten hours and twenty
[19:58] minutes which means as long as I leave
[20:00] here in the next half an hour which will
[20:03] get under thirty hours for the whole run
[20:08] we've travelled 132 kilometers to steep
[20:15] tarmac sections getting out of sin Ives
[20:17] itself but then it's flat rolling all
[20:20] the way around the bay into hail I
[20:23] sometimes briefly say hello to my wife
[20:25] there and grab a quick drink and then
[20:28] it's on to the dunes of do the dunes of
[20:31] doing when I first did it were not wait
[20:33] marked so the staff at art of attrition
[20:36] put glow sticks through so you could
[20:39] find your way through now they've been
[20:41] replaced by big slabs of stone marking
[20:45] every two three hundred meters through
[20:47] the dunes and as long as you keep your
[20:49] eyes out for those markers then you will
[20:51] find your way through the dunes
[20:53] fairly easy I don't relish the idea of
[20:55] doing it in the dark though as the arc
[20:58] fifty runners had to do so the next
[20:59] section you see me arrive at after the
[21:01] dunes of do is Godrevy Godrevy is around
[21:04] about eleven
[21:13] we've got the beach you go past health
[21:48] which is a well-known tourist spot and
[21:51] all the way along to port wreath
[21:54] compared to what's gone before it is
[21:56] relatively easy running it's fairly flat
[21:58] most of the way apart from a little
[22:00] sting just before you get into the truth
[22:03] when there's two down and ups one little
[22:07] nod you go down and you go from steps
[22:09] and then another big valley you all I
[22:12] don't need his family all the way back
[22:14] up again absolutely kills you
[22:15] with six months to go that really hurts
[22:18] but finally you drop down it
[22:41] okay in under 29 hours hopefully so
[22:45] obviously by now I knew I was going to
[22:48] get well as long as nothing disastrous
[22:50] happened I knew I was gonna get under 30
[22:53] hours and if I continue to run
[22:57] relatively well I would get a PB but I
[23:02] was really shattered by now and I hadn't
[23:06] been going the speed that I'd really
[23:07] wanted to go from sir Ives all the way
[23:12] to Patrice I've been really quite slow
[23:15] and it was a bit disappointed in my
[23:18] speed over that terrain so I did pick it
[23:22] up a little bit I've just tried to run
[23:24] in the last four miles five miles from
[23:27] the tree into Port Allen and there's a
[23:31] different finish now to the ARCA
[23:34] patrician they used to end at the blue
[23:36] bar on the beach at Port Allen now you
[23:38] have to run down the hill all the way
[23:41] out of Port Allen and then got another
[23:44] Hill to the finish so it adds another
[23:47] mile onto the run at this point I was on
[23:50] for finish of 28 hours and 30 minutes I
[23:53] wanted to just try and sneak under 28 30
[23:55] so I was pretty pushing it to try and do
[23:57] that
[23:58] [Applause]
[24:20] okay excuse me I've finished know what
[24:36] screw doesn't get those tears at the end
[24:55] recognize will understand hundred miles
[25:00] is a long way
[25:02] 100 miles with much of its almost half
[25:05] of it in the dark is harder still given
[25:10] the terrain given the weather that we
[25:13] had it is an absolute relief to cross
[25:18] the finish line it's a relief that
[25:20] you've crossed it in the first place
[25:21] that you haven't been injured you'll
[25:23] fall into your death down a cliff you
[25:25] haven't had to pull out because you've
[25:28] been sick because you fainted because
[25:30] but for any number of reasons you might
[25:34] DNF a race like that there's a massive
[25:38] outpouring of emotion that happens at
[25:40] that moment that you cross the finish
[25:42] line you're just so incredibly grateful
[25:46] and have been relieved to cross that
[25:49] finish line without any disasters
[25:51] happening that's what those tears are
[25:54] about but and they're also an immense
[25:56] sense of satisfaction and pride and
[26:00] achievement and it's a great it is a
[26:03] great feeling it's a it's a feeling that
[26:05] you don't get very often in life and
[26:07] those those tears are absolutely not
[26:11] embarrassing to me at all it's just
[26:14] something that I do when I've
[26:16] you know it's not doesn't happen every
[26:18] race doesn't happen every race but it
[26:20] happens on those races where I've really
[26:22] been through the ringer and it's really
[26:25] meant a lot to get to that finish line
[26:27] great job but at you I had nothing for
[26:31] that last 20 miles you too flew away
[26:33] brilliant job really good well done you
[26:48] well fastest time 28 and a half just our
[26:55] villains because that bloody hero yeah
[26:59] [Music]
[27:01] but yeah I mean I had a little clown for
[27:05] 27 hours that I thought I probably have
[27:08] not trained up enough for that time and
[27:10] Troon if I wasn't but I went out I went
[27:13] out with that in mind and I got to the
[27:16] last twenty one side left sand ice I had
[27:18] nothing left and there was a lot of
[27:20] struggling this is Laura by the way
[27:28] Laura won today she's and now she how
[27:32] long have you been there since you
[27:34] finished
[27:41] are you just yeah Thank You Laura
[27:52] so we are at the ecological park which
[27:56] is the new finish of the our competition
[27:58] the 100 mile race 104 106 because if you
[28:03] go the wrong way you had plenty of miles
[28:07] but once again we finished once again
[28:10] we've got gold buckle so we can't be
[28:13] anything but happy with that and I'm
[28:16] going to drink coffee and have a long
[28:18] long bath so the next morning we all
[28:24] gathered back at the ecological park for
[28:26] the prize-giving massive congratulations
[28:29] to Kim Karlsen who managed to come in in
[28:31] a new course record time and here is so
[28:34] this is Kim was the winner they are 100
[28:39] this year did you do it I mean it's a
[28:41] hard old gnarly courses
[28:43] today enjoy but it's not really like
[28:52] that first section of a life like they
[28:58] are before tonight's just drain
[29:05] the photo face did you enjoy the winter
[29:09] don't do that 4 o'clock in the morning
[29:11] horizontal hailstones
[29:18] it's not like often at today
[29:21] thank you very much Kim the winner of
[29:25] the arc 100 2019 in a time I'm really
[29:30] sorry it's not a course record which is

[30:08] Hollinger
[30:19] [Music]
[30:26] so the finish line's been taken down
[30:29] we're all going home as a beautiful
[30:31] sunny morning here in port town and that
[30:37] is it for the arc 100 and the arc 50 as
[30:40] well but an absolutely amazing time
[30:43] managed to get a PB 28 hours 31 minutes
[30:46] 39 seconds something like that
[30:49] approximately around about that
[30:51] might be a bit quicker for I hadn't gone
[30:53] off to zen all and added an extra miles
[30:55] my journey but that is the way it is
[30:57] with the arc it's just an adventure if
[31:00] you have even the slightest inkling that
[31:03] you might like to try it you've got to
[31:04] sign up really the arc is an amazing
[31:06] event
[31:07] so that's it to do subscribe to the film
[31:09] our own YouTube channel I will see you
[31:11] again for another adventure another old
[31:12] trend of the mouth and next time take
[31:14] care of
