==================================================

[00:00] Little crisis of confidence going on here.  Well done, 4:30s. Great crowd support out here.
[00:07] Fantastic. Ecstatic and warm. Loving it.
[00:11] Cheers, buddy. How you feeling?  
[00:28] What is it about those 26.2 miles  that captivates us so much? I ran  
[00:35] my first in 2012 and here I am 13 years  later, walking to the start of my 165th.
[00:44] Like any relationship, it's had its  ups and downs. I felt incredible lows,  
[00:50] but no matter how much it hurts, I keep coming  back. Because when it's good, it's bloody amazing.
[00:58] I'm supposed to be in baggage cart B, which is  already gone. This was to be my second Brighton  
[01:04] Marathon in as many years and my 27th road  marathon. Don't get me wrong, I'm not obsessed.
[01:11] I mean, it's not like I have a colour-coded  marathon spreadsheet with filters and embedded  
[01:17] links to Strava. I mean, that would be  mad. I took a last minute trip to the loo.
[01:22] So now there's nobody around. We're gonna kind  of start the run on our own. It's quite nice.
[01:30] We've got Amy here and Carol and look,  
[01:37] not even a countdown or anything,  we just cross the line and we start.  
[01:46] So Brighton Marathon 2025, we are  on our way. Have we finished yet?  
[01:58] So right at the beginning of Brighton  Marathon, there's a beast of a hill.
[02:03] You go through the start line, round a corner and  then it's up, up, up for 500 meters. Anyway, we're  
[02:12] just at the top now. I usually try and show up  in a road marathon and I'll give it my best shot.
[02:19] But this time I'd volunteered to pace my friends,  
[02:22] Carol and Amy. We had no set time  goal in mind, but as the race went on,  
[02:29] things wouldn't quite work out the way any of us  had planned. So we're ticking over quite nicely.
[02:35] Just about to hit three kilometres and just  about to hit the turnaround to go back into  
[02:39] town. If we carried on going this way, we would  hit Gatwick Airport. So we're not going that far.
[02:45] And we've got the beautiful Withdene Park  just behind me here. Here's the turnaround.  
[02:58] So now we're heading back  down towards the seafront.
[03:01] Here's the thing about marathons. Whilst they are  in many way a huge social bonding experience where  
[03:08] friends, family and colleagues run together or  provide support and perfect strangers call out  
[03:15] your name and wish you well, running a marathon  is also a very personal, insular experience.  
[03:23] Just passing Preston Park where we started,  so that's all emptied out now, over there.
[03:29] So it looks like everybody's on their way now in  the Brighton marathon. Just past 5k in 32 minutes.  
[03:43] Bit congested as the road narrows here. When I  was a child, I used to attend church every week.  
[03:51] I don't believe in God anymore, but running  a marathon is a lot like going to church.
[03:56] There's this collective sense of togetherness,  of shared experience and like mindedness,  
[04:03] and yet at the same time you're engaged in  a deeply personal relationship with God,  
[04:08] or in this case, the marathon, which no  one else sees or truly understands. So  
[04:14] this is London Road in Brighton, kind  of a big shopping area just outside  
[04:20] of the main centre of Brighton,  heading south towards the pier.  
[04:45] So just on the right here,  this is the Brighton Dome.
[04:49] I think I said this last year. This is where ABBA  
[04:53] won the Eurovision song contest  in 1970 something or other. Hello.
[05:06] So there's runners running in all  directions now. Runners coming down here,  
[05:11] runners coming back up, and then another set of  
[05:13] runners going back down again. We are  about 8km into the Brighton Marathon.
[05:22] That's the Royal Pavilion over  there, probably Brighton's most  
[05:26] famous tourist attraction. Right. There's  10 kilometres in one hour and six minutes.
[05:43] There's the 4:45 pacers going up the other  way. Now, if the marathon is treating us well,  
[05:49] we tend to embrace the collective bonding  experience. We laugh with strangers,  
[05:54] we wave to the crowd, we enjoy  the atmosphere and the scenery.
[05:59] And we forget about the physical effort of  running. First view of the seafront here. If  
[06:04] things are not going so swimmingly,  we tend to retreat in on ourselves.
[06:09] The marathon becomes a much more introspective  experience. This is both an emotional and a  
[06:16] physical coping mechanism. But it's also often  where we learn the most about who we really are.
[06:23] Come on, Carol. How's it feeling? 12 and a half  K in. There's no way I'm gonna go through this.
[06:33] Just do what you do what you can.  Do your best. You'll be all right.
[06:37] So a little crisis of confidence going on  here. We're about 13k in and. Carol, come on.
[06:46] Yeah, go on, Carol. What are you thinking?  The chimp is overtaking me. The chimp on  
[06:54] your shoulder? Yeah, he's doing  my head and I can't overcome it.
[06:58] I'm just so tired and hot and  I think it's just excuses,  
[07:02] isn't it? Treadmill training for a warm  marathon is not a thing to do. It is warm.
[07:09] It is warm outside. So Carol wants to hang back  a bit and let us go. So the pressure's off,  
[07:18] really, so she can just do what she wants  and make it to the end in her own time and  
[07:23] not worry about me and Amy dragging her  along. So we. We might do that, then.
[07:32] Yeah, I know. Well, I know you of old. I  know you don't like running with people.
[07:51] I'm married to Victoria.  We're not perfect. We argue.
[07:55] I mean, we've got kids. What do you  expect? But we know each other inside  
[08:00] out. We've seen the best and the worst  of each other, but we keep going through  
[08:05] it all because the desire is still  strong and the reward is so great.
[08:11] It's just the same with marathons. Nearly 17  kilometres in, I've left Carol and Amy, but  
[08:19] they did want me to go. They wanted me to go so  they could just relax and not have any pressure.
[08:26] So we're at the turnaround at 17K  and we're at 1 hour 50 minutes,  
[08:44] just climbing the last major  hill in the marathon. After this,  
[08:48] it's pretty much flat all the way and we are  in nearly 18k in right here. He's a 4:30, guys.
[09:04] Well done 4:30s! Right, let's push on a bit. Now.
[09:13] Last year the turnaround  was at the top of that hill,  
[09:16] so we're going on a bit further this  year. By the looks of things. Now,  
[09:20] you might imagine the more experienced you become  at running marathons, the less painful they are.
[09:26] But as anyone who watched my recent  Manchester Marathon video will know,  
[09:31] your relationship with the distance can never be  taken for granted. You may think you've cracked  
[09:37] it. You've had a couple of good years, then all  of a sudden your legs have gone, you're walking  
[09:43] at 10 miles and you're questioning why you ever  started running marathons in the first place.
[09:49] Beautiful view back into Brighton  there with the marina. Funny thing is,  
[09:54] my Manchester finish time was still faster than my  very first marathon in Paris all those years ago.
[10:01] Could it be that what's more important is your  journey to the finish line rather than how fast  
[10:07] you got there? Right, there's 13 miles, so just  point one to go to halfway. How do you measure  
[10:16] marathon success? Let me know in the comments. Is  it by how much you enjoyed the run or by how fast  
[10:23] you ran, regardless of how much fun you had or  how well paced it was? Or is a successful marathon  
[10:30] simply one where you make it to the finish line?  Right, that's halfway in 2 hours and 12 minutes.
[10:38] So let's try and make an effort to get  in under four hours. Right, Coming back  
[10:51] into the centre of Brighton now, here's your  just ahead of me. We're well over halfway.
[10:58] 23 kilometres in 2 hours, 20 minutes. Big thanks  
[11:04] to Protein Rebel for the gels  on today's run. Awesome gels.
[11:10] Thank you Protein Rebel and Flying  Burrito for the amazing shirt. Thanks  
[11:15] again. So if you're not subscribed  to the channel, please do that now.
[11:21] But more importantly, watch to the end of  the video. Make sure I make it to the finish.  
[11:34] I think that with the marathons I've run  has come some wisdom and acceptance that no  
[11:39] matter how much planning and prep you do,  they rarely turn out the way you expect.
[11:45] But also that that's okay. You learn to  take the positives from the bad days or  
[11:50] at least learn some something from them.  And you ride the wave on the good days.
[11:55] And every so often, when you least expect  it, you'll have that perfect day where  
[12:01] everything falls into place. Those are the ones  to really cherish. Great crowd support out here.
[12:09] Fantastic. So just here is Sea Lanes open air  
[12:15] swimming. Really good. Freezing  cold water even in the summer.
[12:26] There's a big project going on at the moment  to rebuild or reclaim these colonnades here.  
[12:33] Beautiful structures and they've been  derelict for quite a few years. So the  
[12:38] council are finally getting their act together to  put them back to the condition they should be in.
[12:54] Right, turn around at the end of  Madeira Drive. We are about 25 and  
[13:00] a half kilometres in. Love it. And  that's the nudist beach over there.
[13:11] And now we're heading back towards the pier  
[13:21] and that is the Volks Electric Railway. It's  
[13:24] the oldest electric railway in  the world, that's still going.
[13:35] So back at the end of Madeira Drive. Pier on  my left and we're now heading up towards the  
[13:43] Grand Hotel and out towards Portslade and  Hove. The great thing about having a colour  
[13:50] coded spreadsheet as I get older is I'm able to  reminisce. You're always going to have regrets.
[13:57] If only I'd taken things easier that day.  
[14:00] I wish I'd been stronger on that  day. But mostly you'll smile.
[14:05] I'm so glad I went there. What a superb day that  was. I remember exactly how I felt at that moment.
[14:13] Marathons make memories that endure,  
[14:16] that grow and inspire. Grand Hotel back  there, and that's the Hilton Hotel there.  
[14:32] That's the famous derelict West Pier over there.
[14:36] And exactly in line with where the West Pier  used to meet the promenade is the Brighton i360  
[14:45] which has just changed hands and will be reopening  again or has reopened again. Brighton i360 there.  
[15:07] 30k in 2 hours and 56 minutes.
[15:13] There's a saying that getting to the start  line of a marathon is a win in itself.  
[15:18] And running the race is your victory  lap, after months of intense training.  
[15:23] There may well be DNFs and even did not  starts, which are all part of your marathon  
[15:28] journey to be embraced, acknowledged,  and from which you learn and grow.
[15:34] It's not always about getting  to the finish line. The road  
[15:37] to the start is littered with broken  dreams. So we just hit 32K, 20 miles.
[15:46] Just about, I think, in 3:07. We're  going to try and get in under four  
[15:51] hours if we can. I'm pretty tired now, but  only 10k to go and great support out here.
[15:59] It's really good. I love your YouTube  video. Oh, cheers, buddy. Thank you.
[16:07] What's your name? Billy. Billy, Cheers, buddy.  How you feeling? Crap. Well, only 10k to go, mate.
[16:15] Here's our 4:15 Pacer. Well done, buddy.  How you feeling? Ecstatic and warm.
[16:25] Loving it. Right, we're in Portslade now,  
[16:34] so in a second we're going to turn back  and head back to Brighton. 33 and a half k.
[16:41] There's something really  special about the last 10km.  
[16:45] Even on a good day. This is where  you find out what you're made of.
[16:49] When your head is doing more work than your legs.  This is where the demons lurk, shouting at you,  
[16:56] why? Why? And it's in finding the answer that  salvation lies. 35 kilometres, 3 hours, 22.
[17:08] See, there must be a reason why we're all here.  
[17:11] And the only way to find out why is to run  the race, to compete, to fight for your place,  
[17:18] knowing that at any moment you could fall  short and taking the risk anyway for that  
[17:24] one moment of euphoria when you can say,  I made it, I did it, I'm not a failure.
[17:32] Just passing Otello, where we ate our  meal last night along Church Road,  
[17:39] heading back into Hove and  then to the finish. 5km to go.
[17:58] And we got 28 minutes to do that. I look  pretty happy here, don't I? And I was,  
[18:05] you know. I really enjoyed the  Brighton Marathon this year.
[18:08] It wasn't a fast time by my standards,  but it was fun. I waved at the crowd,  
[18:13] I chatted to strangers. And I held  the demons back for another day.
[18:19] I found peace in my footfall and the rhythm  of my breathing and a joy in that process.  
[18:36] Some days you'll break, but breaking lets  the healing in. And if you lose your way,  
[18:52] you went further than you've ever been.
[19:01] So just show up, even when you  don't feel ready. Just show up,  
[19:11] though your legs may not be steady. Just  show up, not for medals, not for praise,  
[19:22] but to meet yourself halfway. Trust  the fall. Trust that showing up
[19:33] Just show up, even when you don't feel ready.  Just show up, though your legs may not be steady.  
[19:46] Just show up, not for medals, not for praise,  but to meet yourself halfway. Trust the fall.  
[20:00] Trust that showing up is all.
[20:14] Had to push at the end there, but I think I got in  
[20:17] under four. So I really started to  struggle actually in the last 10k.
[20:24] It is warm when you run.
[20:25] It's not so warm when you're standing around  because there's a breeze, but when you're running,  
[20:28] it's really warm. So actually, yeah, I  started to struggle, but we just scraped in,  
[20:36] I think just under four hours. So that was a  bit more of a training run than I'd planned.
[20:46] Bit faster than I thought I was going to go. But,  
[20:48] you know, you get caught up in the moment,  don't you? I loved it. I enjoyed it.
[20:54] The last two times I've done Brighton, I've  been really impressed with the organisation  
[20:59] and how well supported it is. Just really  had a good time. What I don't like about  
[21:03] the Brighton Marathon is once you've  finished, they keep you moving forward.
[21:07] There's nowhere. Like you've just run 26  miles and they want you to stand up and  
[21:12] just keep moving into this crowd when all  you want to do is just sit down and chill  
[21:16] out for 10 minutes. But you know what? It is  what it is and it's absolutely crazy packed.
[21:25] You don't run 26.2 miles for a medal.
[21:29] You run it to remember what it feels like to  be fully alive. To wrestle with your limits,  
[21:35] to face your fears. To be broken, but continue  on. The marathon gives you nowhere to hide. It  
[21:44] strips everything back until all that's  left is the real you, raw, laid bare.  
[21:51] In those final miles when the  noise fades and the crowd blurs,  
[21:56] you realise this was never about running.  You know, this was never about running.
[22:03] Life isn't a marathon. It's hundreds  of them strung together. Some calm,  
[22:09] some stormy, some beautiful.
[22:13] You may never truly know why you're here. All  you can do is keep showing up. For yourself,  
[22:20] for the people who believe in you.
[22:22] And sometimes the ones who don't.  It's a long road and sometimes it  
[22:27] hurts. But it's only by breaking that we can heal.
[22:32] And when we're healed, we get to live, to  feel, to love and to run all over again.  
[22:41] Just show up. Even when you  don't feel ready. Just show up,  
[22:51] though your legs may not be steady.  Just show up. The late afternoon sun.
[22:58] Everyone who we came down with,  
[23:00] has now finished. Carol's crossed the  line. What was it? 6? 17. 6 hours 17.
[23:07] We've had a really lovely day.  It's been hard work, though.
[23:11] That is the Brighton Marathon, 2025. Thank you  so much for watching. Don't forget to subscribe.
