[00:01] I'm trying to film you two!!  Getting me sacked from my job!!  
[00:10] Good morning welcome to Film My Run.  Here we are at the marathon I do every  
[00:14] year. It's the Three Forts Challenge. It's not  actually a marathon, it's way more than that.  
[00:18] It's 20... what is it? It's 27 miles, over  the South Downs. It's a really lovely run.  
[00:26] It might be a bit cooler than normal today,  but we don't care, we're going to enjoy  
[00:31] ourselves. I'm going to run around with my  friend Dan here. Hello! I don't know if you  
[00:35] ever watch science channels but Dan's got a  massive science channel. It is, it's massive!
[00:54] This is Steve, originally from Minnesota. If  any of you are going to follow my Lakeland  
[01:00] training plan, Steve's doing Lakeland  100. He's not filling me with confidence.  
[01:06] Hallucinations, 38 hours. That's what makes a  race fun yeah? You don't remember the boring ones.  
[01:16] You remember the ones that  chew you up. This is true!
[01:21] Did you say cheer you up? Chew you up. Maybe spit you out and chomp on you again yeah! Right this is Nuala.  
[01:30] How many marathons are you now on? This  will be 179. And what's the ultimate goal?  
[01:35] To get to my 200. Oh yeah you've done every single  Brighton Marathon haven't you? Yes. Some of you  
[01:40] might know Deborah. So in two weeks you've got  the North Downs Way 50. You've just finished the  
[01:45] South Downs Way 50 and then you're going to do  South Downs Way 100. So you think i'm bonkers!  
[01:55] Hi guys. Well we're having a  very nice time. We are 11k in.  
[02:01] Just passing the River Adur, over the bridge and  then on up to Devil's Dyke. So if you want to  
[02:08] go and run a beautiful marathon in London,  one I've done a couple of times called the  
[02:13] Vanguard Way. Go and check out my video  of it, but Gareth is the race director.  
[02:19] Known Gareth for a few years. Always good events,  always enjoyable. So go and do one of his events.
[02:27] First aid station. Because we're having a bit of  a jolly today, it's nice to stop and have a drink.  
[02:32] Look Johnny Burke!! This is the first time Dan and  I have run together. We've been trying to organize  
[02:38] a run together for months it seems, but it's  never quite happened. But today it has and I  
[02:44] know Dan because I started watching his youtube  channel, and it's not a running youtube channel.  
[02:50] I don't know if you've ever seen SciManDan, but  he does science videos. Tell me a little bit about  
[02:55] your channel Dan. Oh it's basically taking the  mick out of Flat Earthers and other conspiracy  
[03:01] theories. It's not the only conspiracy theory, but  yeah. So just try and debunk them with logic and  
[03:07] facts and science. It seems to do all right.  Well you say it seems to do all right,  
[03:13] so how many subscribers have you currently got  Dan? I think I've got 445 thousand, just passed.
[03:20] 445 000!! The biggest running channel in the UK,  or in fact in the world, Ithink, is The Running  
[03:32] Channel. They're just about to hit 500 000. That's  a target! So Dan really is not far behind that.  
[03:40] Amazing. But you have got your own running channel  as well haven't you. I have, but it's a lot  
[03:44] smaller than that. So tell everyone what that's  called. It's imaginatively titled RunManDan.  
[04:08] So some bits of this course are really steep  and gnarly. But what you know is they don't go  
[04:14] on for very long. So that's the good thing, and  then you you're on to the nice soft grass again.
[04:22] This is the turnaround point  up at Devil's Dyke. Hello guys!
[04:27] But it's not halfway!
[04:33] All good?
[04:40] My cup matches my top look.  
[04:43] It's all downhill now. Oh yeah, you say  that. I've done this race before you know!
[04:52] Yes, thank you.
[04:56] Right we're not quite halfway yet. We think we're  going to probably do about five hours. If you are  
[05:01] enjoying watching I am trying to get myself to 10  000 subscribers. I'm not far off now, so if you  
[05:06] wouldn't mind just clicking that subscribe button.  I really appreciate it. You know I hate asking.
[05:22] Okay 30k in. Hello Switzerland is here! Hey  Switzerland. You didn't come all the way from  
[05:29] Switzerland to do this race did you? Well not  for this one. She probably lives in Goring.
[05:39] Look i'm trying to film you two!  You can get me sacked from my job!
[05:47] Right, I tell you, you're gonna ruin yourselves  for the last five miles! So we've got about eight  
[05:52] miles to go. Thomas is absolutely done for. He  can't run another step. The last time i filmed  
[05:59] Russ was with a 360 camera and he was behind  me and he fell over and it was hilarious.
[06:12] So up ahead of us is the third of our Iron Age  
[06:15] hill forts. This is Chanctonbury  Ring, we're just approaching now.  
[06:26] I'm good, thank you guys.
[06:32] Right, we're on the last major climb. I  have to say I am feeling it. I'm tired.  
[06:40] Four miles to go. We're nearly there. Last  little bit of climbing and we'll soon be done.  
[06:51] So final aid station on the way  home. We've got about 3k to go.  
[06:56] All right, so, squash doesn't normally sit  very well with me. But we're near the finish.  
[07:02] Yeah, no, straight up here. Straight  up here! No, no, no, not that way!
[07:08] I I'm beginning to see how you did go wrong!  
[07:11] We've just passed a photographer and we didn't  run up the hill. Now we look like complete morons.
[07:23] Marathon completed on the Three Forts Challenge.  But as we all know the Three Forts Challenge  
[07:28] is more than a marathon. We've got just over a  kilometre to go. All right Dan? Bringing it home.  
[07:35] Come on! I couldn't do the sprint at the end.
[07:41] Here we come. Here's the finish.
[08:02] We are done here and I tell you what,  I really am done. Hello Deborah.  
[08:08] Really done me in that has. And I am blaming  Dan because he made me talk all the way around,  
[08:13] and that sapped my energy. What have you got  to say for yourself Dan? I'm eternally sorry.  
[08:20] You were fine! We've had a lovely day.  We came in, in four hours and 46 minutes.  
[08:28] So not bad at all considering we were going for  five. So that's it, a nice short one. See you for  
[08:34] the next one. Don't forget, if you are enjoying  this content, do subscribe down below and what
