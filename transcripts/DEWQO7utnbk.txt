==================================================

[00:01] Your comfort zone is a desolate wasteland. Nothing  
[00:05] will ever grow there. And you miss  100% of the shots you don't take.
[00:12] So sometimes you need to take those shots,  even if it will probably end in failure.  
[00:18] Today's video is another vital lesson  in race management, risk versus reward,  
[00:24] and the importance of pre-race prep. It's  been a bit of a manic morning trying to get  
[00:30] here on time, even though it's only  a 40-minute drive from our house.
[00:34] We got here in plenty of time, but then there  was a massive queue outside. So the traffic has  
[00:40] been mad. But we're in the queue now to get  my number for Race to the King this morning.
[00:46] 100K starting — well, technically  starting in 15 minutes.  
[00:57] Okay, so I've got my race number, need to  go back to the van, have a couple of drinks,  
[01:01] get some lube on, and I think then  we'll be ready. I've put sun cream on.
[01:06] It's going to be really warm  today. Notice that Clive is  
[01:14] wearing the virtual FMR t-shirts  — I haven't even got one of those!  
[01:20] In my rush to get to the start line, I'd  neglected to apply any anti-chafe cream.
[01:25] Keep an eye on that nugget of information as the  race progresses. Welcome to somewhere. Chichester.
[01:33] This is West Dean Gardens near Chichester.  We're about to run Race to the King,  
[01:36] which is 100 kilometres. It's got  about 1,500 metres of elevation.
[01:40] Consists of two 50K loops — one  flat loop and one hilly loop on  
[01:44] the South Downs. We're going to start in  about two minutes. It's about 7:10 a.m.
[01:50] Obviously hoping to get done before dark  tonight. This is Clive. This is Penny.
[01:57] I don't know whether I'm going to see  them during the run. We're all going  
[01:59] to do our own thing and hopefully get  to the finish unscathed. Literary kits.
[02:04] Come on. Good one, guys.  
[02:28] This is Penny's country home.
[02:34] We're in West Dean Gardens. I don't know  what building that is, but it's very nice.  
[02:44] I knew there'd be troublemakers on this run.
[02:49] Steve, we've got Tom. He makes real  videos. You could learn a thing or two.
[02:54] See the abuse I have to put up with?  And don't die in the sun, Steve. Yeah.
[03:00] Oh dear. Don't talk to me about that. Yeah.
[03:02] See you in the middle of your video.  Start there with your head in the  
[03:04] river. That is almost a given,  even if I'm having a good race.
[03:09] Yeah. Not only is this Sam's first  ultra, not only is this Sam's first 100K,  
[03:16] not only is this Sam's first trail race  — this is Sam's first ever race. It is.
[03:22] What possessed you? Uh, I got a little bit ill a few years ago,  
[03:26] and it was on my bucket list. And then I started  running 18 months ago, and now we're here.
[03:32] The first 10 kilometres of Race to the  King mostly follows the Centurion Way  
[03:36] railway path from West Dean through Lavant  to Chichester. The old Chichester to Midhurst  
[03:43] railway finally closed in 1991, and the path  was opened to walkers and cyclists in 1995.
[03:51] 10 kilometres in, in just under an hour. So that's  probably a bit too fast. But it's been very easy,  
[03:59] runnable ground — on tarmac paths — and also  with the first 50K being relatively flat.
[04:09] It's also tempting to bank a bit of  time, which I always advise never to do,  
[04:15] but I don't know. We'll just see what  happens. So I'm just going to keep going  
[04:25] at a relatively comfortable  pace until the heat gets me.
[04:31] Full of bravado and confidence, I ran straight  past the first pit stop and on to Chichester  
[04:37] Harbour, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,  where we ran through wetlands and past beaches at  
[04:44] Bosham and Chidham. Against my better judgement,  I'd made the decision to try and bank some time.
[04:51] I never do this, and I know it almost always  ends in tears, but this time I thought,  
[04:57] let's just see what happens. You never know — you  might get away with it. So I continued to run,  
[05:03] ignoring my years of experience, despite the heat  and still having not applied any anti-chafe cream.
[05:11] How are we feeling? Feeling a bit tired — the 50K today, but, mate... 
[05:15] Oh, you're nearly halfway through. Mate, you inspired me for my first marathon, which  
[05:19] was Paris — the city I love. And I watched your  2016 video, and I signed up the following year,  
[05:28] and that got me into a bit of a running journey.  But, mate, I can't believe I've seen you — legend! 
[05:34] You go for it, man. It's the 100K today, right? Yeah, 100K today. 
[05:38] So nearly a quarter of the way through. Yes. 
[05:41] Get in there. Don't love you,  buddy. It's good meeting you, buddy. 
[05:45] What's your name? Sorry — Marvin. 
[05:46] Marvin, nice to meet you,  mate. Nice to meet you, buddy.
[05:51] Like a complete idiot, I've done  the first quarter — that's just over  
[05:56] 25K — in two and a half hours.  That's pretty stupid, really.
[06:02] It's been such runnable ground —  stuff like this tarmac. You know,  
[06:07] there have been these trails like this here, but  mostly it's been really easy, runnable ground,  
[06:16] and it's been too tempting to run, so I've  run far too fast, far too hard, far too early.
[06:24] You know, if I was to repeat  that for the whole race,  
[06:27] that's 10 hours. I can't do 10  hours. I can do 12 on a good day.
[06:33] 14 is my goal. So I just need to stop running and  
[06:40] just chill out for a bit. I feel  okay, but it's just — you know.
[06:46] Hi, buddy. You just know the heat's going to catch  
[06:48] up with you. You know the distance  is going to catch up with you.
[06:52] And if we don't look after ourselves  now, it will be carnage later on.
[07:01] 2 hours, 37 minutes, 26.5 km — checkpoint two. So  
[07:08] I'm going to stop here and  have some food and drink.
[07:12] You can see in my face that I already know I've  been an idiot and the early pace is already  
[07:17] catching up with me. I definitely needed  this pit stop in the village of Chidham.
[07:23] This is Ed. We're at the second pit stop. Ed's the  guy who convinces me to do these kinds of things.
[07:30] Persuades you. 
[07:30] How do you think you're  going to cope with it today? 
[07:32] I think people are looking  actually okay. We're not seeing  
[07:37] too many dehydrated-looking people just yet.  Cloud coverage has come in, which is quite nice.
[07:42] Early days, it's muggy. Early days, isn't it? 
[07:44] Yeah, 100%. Cheers Ed. 
[07:46] Nice one. Take care.
[07:48] I made my way to Nutbourne and my first crew stop,  
[07:52] where — better late than never —  I finally managed to apply some  
[07:55] anti-chafe cream before heading back inland  and crossing the West Coastway railway line.
[08:03] 32 kilometres in, 3 hours 26 minutes. Got my ice,  
[08:08] got my coconut water. This  train is taking forever.
[08:19] Okay, I think we're all right. Just  seen Victoria. So I've had an ice lolly,  
[08:35] I've had a tomato and coconut  water and a cup of tea.
[08:47] I'm going to take my sunglasses off  for this because there's a man with  
[08:51] a hosepipe here. Just a little  bit. Thank you. Lovely. Cheers.
[09:04] Yeah, the heat has hit, so drastically  slowed now — but that's fine. You know,  
[09:10] I knew the first bit was  going to be quick. Too quick.
[09:15] We'll just carry on now dealing with the heat.  But it's just what we expected. It's fine.
[09:24] This is absolutely classic behaviour. I'm clearly  trying to talk myself into positivity, but the  
[09:31] truth is, it's now far too hot for me. I'm already  dying anyway, having gone off far too fast, and  
[09:38] despite having applied anti-chafe cream, things  are starting to rub in unmentionable places.
[09:45] By the way, this place on my right  — it is a radar testing facility  
[09:48] and was a very sensitive defence  site during the Cold War period.
[09:53] Heading to Pit Stop 3, things  really weren't looking good for me,  
[09:58] and I was going to need a huge  stroke of fortune to turn it around.
[10:02] I'm not going into Pit Stop 3 because Victoria  is meeting me in 4K, so there's no need to go  
[10:09] in there really. I mean, I'd love to go in and  lie down and swig loads of coffee and stuff,  
[10:15] but I shouldn't really because  I'm going to sit down in 4K.
[10:22] 4 hours and 9 minutes for 37 kilometres. So  I've definitely been walking a lot more in  
[10:28] these last 5K. The good news was, although  it was humid, at least we weren't running in  
[10:36] direct sunlight. There was cloud cover and  these beautiful sections of forest trail.
[10:42] Despite walking more, I was  definitely also still running,  
[10:46] and so far I was still ahead of my  goal time of 14 hours. But with plenty  
[10:52] of hills to come in the second half, I  couldn't afford to slow down any more.
[10:58] So this place has really been  taken over as a crew stop. Just  
[11:02] seen Victoria. We're just packing the  hair and hands. Got myself a Lucozade.
[11:07] Hi guys.
[11:09] And we are just shy of a marathon in just shy of  five hours. 4 hours, 55 minutes. Marathon done.
[11:19] Thanks.
[11:34] In the greatest news ever, it has started to rain.
[11:39] In the worst news ever, just as it starts to rain,  
[11:42] we've come into a forest, so we're not getting  the benefit of the rain falling on our heads.  
[11:47] But the sound of it is just lush. Just  hearing the rain makes me feel cooler.
[11:57] Been absolutely burning up  the past 10 or 15K. We're  
[12:01] not too far off base camp now —  about 5K away — so that's good.
[12:19] So Jamie's doing the 50K slowly.
[12:23] How you feeling in the hot weather? Yeah, not too bad, mate. Not too bad.  
[12:26] A bit sick, struggling a bit, but it's  clouded over now, so it's not too bad.
[12:35] Yeah, well, I'm just — everyone on here knows I'm  just surviving this section in the hot weather and  
[12:41] then hoping it cools down a little later on. Now,  I actually feel okay, but I'm walking because I've  
[12:49] just had a text message from Victoria to say she's  struggling to get to base camp halfway before me.
[12:58] We're in West Dean Gardens now. Got  about 500 metres to the checkpoint,  
[13:03] which will be 50K in just over six hours —  6 hours, 5 minutes or something. But yeah,  
[13:10] I'm just taking my time because I want  to get there and Victoria be there,  
[13:16] because it's a long time  till I see her again, so...
[13:22] And I'm happy enough with my time. I was  never going to keep up that early first  
[13:29] 25K speed. That was just crazy. But we're on  pace for... I'd like to do around 14 hours,  
[13:39] but we'll see. That's what I'm kind of aiming  for, and we're on pace for that at the moment.
[13:50] Well done, you. Thank you. Good job. Doing well.
[13:57] Okay, I'm at the halfway pit stop. I've just  got myself some Vaseline — just to put on, well,  
[14:03] you know what I'm talking about — because Victoria  is not going to make it here. She's not going to  
[14:07] make it to the halfway stop, so I'm having to  fend for myself. I mean, what's that all about?
[14:15] But we are now 50K in with 52K to go.
[14:32] Okay. Some watermelon, a banana, filled  up my water bottles, two glasses of Coke,  
[14:38] and we're done and we're out of here. It's  so much nicer when the temperature is lower.
[14:49] I feel okay, so that's good. I was a bit worried  at about 30K because it was sweltering hot,  
[14:59] and I just thought, this is going to  be another one of those where I just  
[15:03] have nothing. But if it stays like  this, then I think we might be okay.
[15:22] The village of Singleton, apparently. 52K.
[15:28] I started the second loop of Race to the  King full of optimism. I love the rolling  
[15:34] hills of the South Downs and I knew  much of the route I was about to do.  
[15:38] The change in the weather meant that, against  the odds, I might actually have received that  
[15:43] huge stroke of fortune I needed to  get this done without capitulating.
[15:48] We just don't want the sun to come out again. The  
[15:52] climb took us up from West Dean and onto  the South Downs Way just east of Cocking.
[15:58] Right, this is a very important sign. 60K done,  and that means a marathon to go. And you know  
[16:09] what? It's raining, the sun has gone in, and I'm  feeling okay. I'm able to run, which is fantastic.
[16:20] I'm tired, a bit sore, got a  little bit of chafing issues,  
[16:26] but nothing I can't handle. I'm really, really  enjoying this now. 7 hours, 34 minutes for 60K.
[16:37] This is a 102K race, so marathon to go. If  you're not already subscribed to the channel,  
[16:48] please consider doing that now. And do watch to  
[16:51] the end of the video just to see  if I make it to the finish line.
[17:11] The sun is threatening to come  out again. It's just got very,  
[17:13] very humid again. Just climbed a big hill,  nearly 64 kilometres in. 8 hours and 10 minutes.
[17:26] Looking forward to seeing my  wife and getting some more ice,  
[17:28] I think, because it's heating up again now.
[17:32] I met Victoria at Bignor Hill. I got a  new ice bandana but didn't manage to eat  
[17:37] anything. My stomach was starting to turn  and nausea was becoming an issue. The sun  
[17:44] was out from behind the clouds and didn't look  like it was about to disappear anytime soon.
[17:49] Anyone who's watched my South Downs Way  100 videos knows this section heading  
[17:54] down to Horton Farm and Amberley is very exposed.
[18:01] 9 hours and 9 minutes, 70K done. So just 20  miles to go — 32K. It's hot. I'm suffering,  
[18:12] but I'm just about running. And if  I'm running, that's a good thing.
[18:23] Just coming through Amberley now — 72.5,  nearly 73 kilometres. Got an aid station  
[18:31] coming up — a pit stop, as they call them  on these Threshold events — any minute now.
[18:59] We love the wobbly bridge. Haven’t been  on this wobbly bridge for quite some time,  
[19:02] so nice to go on it again. We  should run over it, really.
[19:21] Okay, boys and girls, here's the situation:  75 kilometres done in 10 hours and 2 minutes.  
[19:30] Now that, I think, means I'm not  going to make my 14-hour target.
[19:37] The heat has got me. I've got no ice left.  So we're just going to have to get it done  
[19:43] as best we can. 14 and a half hours — something  like that. If all goes okay, that'll be fine.
[19:52] We are heading down towards Arundel now.  We've got the River Arun on the left.  
[20:12] Arundel Castle is over there somewhere. It's  very pretty, but I'm too hot to appreciate it.
[20:26] 78 kilometres done. 10 hours 29 minutes.
[20:31] This was the toughest section of the race  for me. There was a long steep ascent away  
[20:36] from the beautiful Swanbourne Lake and  up through the equally stunning Arundel  
[20:41] Park. I slowed to an absolute crawl on  the exposed climb and was caught by a  
[20:48] number of runners who had seemingly all  managed their races much better than I.
[20:53] You can't say we haven't been treated  to some absolutely lovely views. I may  
[20:58] be completely wrecked now with 22K to go —  look at that. That's so beautiful, isn't it?
[21:09] My stomach is awful. Feel like I'm going  to be sick any minute. The heat is just  
[21:16] sapping everything I've got, really, at the  moment. Only 22K to go — it's not that bad.
[21:23] So we'll get it done in whatever time we get  it done in — even if it's 15 or 16 hours.
[21:32] Quite often I'll try to put a brave face  on things when talking to camera. Believe  
[21:36] it or not, I do like to be positive most  of the time, but this was no longer fun.
[21:42] I saw my wife one final time with 20K to go and  had a bit of a sense of humour failure at Horton.
[21:49] The saving grace was that it was  finally cooling down a little,  
[21:53] but by now there was very  little running left in my legs.
[21:58] 12 hours, 13 minutes. Exactly  10 miles to go. 16.1 kilometres.
[22:07] It's definitely cooled down. My problem now,  right now, is I have really bad chafing, and it's  
[22:17] really painful. Even though it's getting cooler,  I still feel pretty warm. So the ice is helping.
[22:28] Checkpoint in about 3.5K, and then 12K to home.
[22:36] I had been fourth in my age category up  to this point, but in the final 10K I was  
[22:42] passed by two guys and had to settle  for sixth out of 34 in my age group.
[22:48] The chafing had been caused by me not  applying anti-chafe cream at the start,  
[22:52] and then too much iced water melting  down my back and into my shorts.
[22:58] In the end, it was a combination  of the heat, the chafing pain,  
[23:02] and ultimately my pace over the  first 20K which was my downfall.
[23:08] I came into the finish of Race to  the King in 15 hours and 10 minutes.
[23:14] Thank you.
[23:16] Right, so screwed I’m not running across  the line. We've done 103K. Crossing the  
[23:29] finish line of Race to the King — and that's a  lesson: don’t go off too fast at the beginning.
