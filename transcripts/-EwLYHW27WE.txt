==================================================

[00:00] It's nearly 07:00 in the morning. I've  arrived in… I don’t know where we are.
[00:07] We’re in a field. We were, in  fact, at Field Farm in Lewknor,  
[00:13] Oxfordshire. The start line of Race to the Stones.
[00:16] 2024, now in its 11th year, Race to the Stones  can rightfully call itself a classic British  
[00:23] ultra race. Despite sitting somewhat on the  periphery of the core UK ultra-running scene,  
[00:30] it's often regarded as a beginner's ultra or great  
[00:34] for first-timers. I'm about  to start Race to the Stones.
[00:38] It's a race that I've known about for  many years and never really thought  
[00:42] about doing. I got invited –  very nice of Ed to invite me.
[00:46] Thank you very much. Here I am. We’re going to run  100 km non-stop. You can do this over two days,  
[00:53] 50 km one day, 50 km the next, but we’re  just going to go for the whole thing,  
[00:57] get it over and done with, eat lots of cake, and  enjoy ourselves. Right, I better get lined up.
[01:04] Right, I’ve done all the necessaries  – I think you know what I’m talking  
[01:08] about – and we’re going to line up for  the 07:30 wave of Race to the Stones.
[01:15] We met up with our friends, Rebecca and Lee,  and Lee and I agreed to start together as we  
[01:20] were both in the same start wave.  The race briefing was followed by  
[01:24] something you just wouldn’t normally  see in most ultra events – a series of  
[01:30] warm-up exercises led by a fitness instructor on  a podium. Just one of those little things that  
[01:36] makes it different from some of the other events  I do. Right, here we go with Race to the Stones.
[01:43] 100 km all the way to Avebury  Stones, and we're off across the mat.  
[02:09] There are a lot of people here – apparently  about 3,000 over the course of the two days.
[02:17] I don't know what the ratio is of men to women,  
[02:21] but Threshold are trying to make it 50/50,  so let's hope they've got close to that,  
[02:26] at least. Two men are leaving their  wives in the vans. "Hello, buddy."
[02:34] "Yes, I've been following! It's  me, Phil. Nice to meet you."
[02:37] "Good luck! What are you doing, all in one?"
[02:39] "Yes, first time."
[02:41] "Oh, good luck!"
[02:42] "Yeah, thanks very much." and you.
[02:43] We’ve just come out onto this beautiful open  field as we hit 5 km – 32 minutes. The first  
[02:50] few kilometres were on narrow paths through  the woods, with a few sneaky climbs thrown in.
[02:56] At this stage, the temperature  was cool, and we were mostly in  
[02:59] the shade. Just over 10 km in – 1 hour  and 10 minutes. Relatively comfortable.
[03:08] It's very tempting to go too fast on this route  because it's relatively flat, and we’re early on,  
[03:16] and we feel good. So, we’ll see if  it comes back to bite us later on.
[03:21] "You alright, Lee?"
[03:22] "Yeah, I’m all good, thank you.  Enjoying this? Enjoying the company?"
[03:25] "Yeah, we’ll just keep cracking on  and see how it goes. Not bad out  
[03:37] here, not bad."
[03:40] It’s not raining. So, we’re now  on the route of the Autumn 100,  
[03:48] which we did with Victoria last year.
[03:52] We’re on the second spur and we’re kind of on the  way back, as though you were going back to Goring  
[03:57] and Streatley and the village hall there. When  Victoria and I did this, it was just getting dark.
[04:07] So, it's about 12 miles from here to  Goring, and that’s where I’m going  
[04:09] to meet Victoria today. Race to the  Stones takes place on the Ridgeway,  
[04:15] said to be Britain’s oldest road, with  its use dating back some 5,000 years.
[04:21] It was used by Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Age  communities, as well as the Romans. Traders,  
[04:28] pilgrims, and soldiers used the Ridgeway’s  elevated position to stay safe from ambush  
[04:34] and wild animals in the forests below. The  national trail runs 87 miles from Ivinghoe  
[04:40] Beacon in Buckinghamshire, west to Overton Hill  near the Avebury stone circle and our finish line.
[04:48] Right, Lee and I have done 20 km now in 2 hours,  
[04:52] 14 minutes. We are still feeling okay on  the Ridgeway in Race to the Stones, 100 km.
[05:03] We should be coming up on a little village called  North Stoke in the next couple of kilometres,  
[05:09] which will hopefully be the  next aid station or pit stop,  
[05:12] as they call them in this race.  Right, that’s a half marathon done.
[05:23] As we approach the second pit stop, I’ve got  to keep remembering to call it a pit stop here.  
[05:32] Going to stop for a little bite to  eat and get some fluids on board. As  
[05:39] I’m not wearing my race vest, I need  to make sure we stay on top of that.
[05:44] So, here we are. Oh look, there are  tables and chairs and everything.  
[05:49] I wonder if there’s a Costa  here somewhere… Probably not.
[05:55] Look, the sandwiches are wrapped.  This is madness. It’s like they’ve  
[06:01] been to Tesco and bought them! Sweet  potato falafel – I could see it coming.
[06:09] "Love the videos, by the way."
[06:10] "Cheers, buddy, thank you."
[06:12] Chocolate Freddos. Look, Penguin bars,  Jelly Tots, Dairy Milk chocolate. Then  
[06:20] you’ve got your usual aid station fare, like  bananas, watermelon, oranges, and pineapple.
[06:33] This is crazy, isn’t it? It’s like a  café. A kid’s picnic. "What’s your name?"
[06:38] "Darren."
[06:38] "Darren. Where are you from, Darren?"
[06:40] "Birmingham."
[06:40] "And why are you here?"
[06:42] "To run 100 km."
[06:43] "Is it your first one?"
[06:44] "It’s my first 100 km, yeah."
[06:46] "Nice, nice. What have you done before?"
[06:48] "I’ve done some fifties and an eighty."
[06:50] "Yeah? Nervous about it or are you confident?"
[06:52] "No, I’m enjoying it so far. The  first 20 would be now, though, guy."
[06:55] "Yeah. Nice to meet you."
[06:57] "You too. See you soon, cheers."
[06:58] Two cups of semi-skimmed milk, one cup of  oat milk. I’ve nicked two chocolate bars,  
[07:05] and I think that’s me done.  Me and Lee are going to go.
[07:13] Away we go. We’ve got 6 miles to Streatley,  where I’m going to meet Victoria.
[07:21] "Thank you, appreciate that."
[07:23] We’re 2 hours 26 minutes in, just over  half a marathon. Morning, guys. Good job.
[07:31] Lee and I were making good progress, and  I was thoroughly enjoying taking advantage  
[07:36] of another quirk of the race – the complete  lack of any mandatory kit requirement. I was  
[07:42] carrying one water bottle in my waist belt, and  with the aid stations and my family crewing me,  
[07:48] I felt supported and very happy  with my decision to travel light.
[08:02] 28.5 km – I’ve been here for about ten minutes,  maybe a bit longer than that. Now it’s 3 hours 23.
[08:10] Victoria and the kids arrived  just as I was getting to this  
[08:13] little checkpoint here at Goring.  We’re just at Goring, Streatley,  
[08:17] where we do the Autumn 100 from. I’m just about  ready to go now, so thank you very much, guys.
[08:28] The guys have just done Parkrun this morning  at Didcot, and I’m delighted to be in Goring.  
[08:36] And what did we do in Goring? You  want to do that again, don’t you?
[08:39] "I do."
[08:39] Victoria wants to do the Autumn 100 again.  She’s mad. Right, I’m going to get on my way.
[08:44] "Oh look. Yes. All right, see  you later, guys. Love you too."
[08:51] I’ll see you at base camp in about two  and a half hours, yeah. All right, bye.
[08:58] Right, let’s get into Goring village just down  the bottom of the hill here, and then carry on.  
[09:04] 28.5 km. We’ve got just over a half marathon to  go to get to halfway and the base camp pit stop.
[09:14] "You can’t cheer me if I’m not running."
[09:21] The neighbouring villages of Goring and  Streatley are in different counties,  
[09:26] separated by a bridge across the Thames, and  they serve as the start and finish location  
[09:31] for the Centurion Autumn 100 race,  which I did with Victoria last year.
[09:37] 4 hours 17 minutes, 35 km, and we’re just  coming into the next checkpoint, pit stop,  
[09:43] aid station – whatever you want to call it.
[09:46] "Thank you."
[09:49] So, just a quick stop here. We’ll just  go to the loo and grab some water.
[10:00] These are amazing aid stations,  
[10:03] really. You’re really wrapped in cotton  wool in this race, that’s for sure.
[10:09] Right. Just leaving the checkpoint.  Had a cup of milk, went to the loo,  
[10:14] and just had a little bit of water here. So, I’m  just going to walk out with this water. 35 km.
[10:20] So, 15 km to the halfway base camp,  
[10:24] where a lot of people sleep, and  they’ll do the next 50 km tomorrow.  
[10:43] Right, that is marathon distance  done in 5 hours 20 minutes.
[10:49] 8 km to go to base camp and the halfway point.  Very warm now. It’s a big crew point here.
[10:59] Lots of people meeting their family and friends.  I have a feeling I was trying to look good for the  
[11:07] camera here because I was definitely starting to  suffer a little in the increasing humidity. Whilst  
[11:13] it wasn’t sunny, the cloud cover was making  everything feel very close and uncomfortable.
[11:19] I was glad of my one water bottle  and was already looking forward  
[11:23] to seeing Victoria at the halfway base camp.
[11:27] 5 hours 56 minutes and we are just  approaching 46 km. Here we go.
[11:36] And it has got hot. We’re on top of the  Ridge and we’re 4 km from base camp,  
[11:44] the halfway point. But I’m getting cooked here.
[11:50] It’s humid, there’s cloud cover,  and it’s really close and hot.
[11:55] One thing I am going to moan about  – that I’m very disappointed about –  
[11:59] is the amount of litter on the floor. Gel  wrappers, sweet wrappers, crisp packets.
[12:07] Far more than you would get on,  say, a Centurion event. You know,  
[12:13] far be it from me to say it’s anything  to do with the type of runner you get on  
[12:18] these kinds of events, but I think there’s  certainly a bit to be learned by those who  
[12:29] are on this event about not dropping litter.  I will show you some examples if I see some.
[12:45] I’m sure the race directors wouldn’t be happy with  the amount of litter either. I’m not blaming the  
[12:50] race directors at all. And maybe the back markers  will be sweeping up and clearing up the litter  
[13:00] as they come along the course.
[13:02] But nevertheless, the participants themselves need  to sort themselves out. Really. It’s not great.
[13:11] Sure enough, in this 2 km section before reaching  base camp, I spotted numerous examples of litter  
[13:17] clearly dropped recently and almost certainly  by runners in the event. This is a basic and  
[13:24] simple lesson for all those new to trail  and ultra-running. In most races I do...
[13:30] If you are found to be littering, the result  is immediate disqualification. When you join  
[13:36] the trail running community, respect  for the environment is fundamental – a  
[13:40] given. We leave the trails as we find  them for others to enjoy after us.
[13:48] "Thank you."  "Oh it's Film My Run guy!"
[13:50] "Hello!" "Beachy Head!"
[13:52] "Oh, hello Sam. Nice to see you."
[13:56] Right, the last time we passed that monument was  on the Autumn 100. It was dark, cold, and windy,  
[14:04] but fortunately, we’re 48 km in now, and I  can see base camp just up ahead there. So,  
[14:11] we’re going to get there, have some food, relax  a little, and then start on the second half.
[14:17] It is warm today, but I mean, beautiful. Look at  the views over here. Right on top of the Ridge.
[14:25] Here on the Ridgeway camp are those white  tents. You might just be able to see them in  
[14:31] the distance there. We’re going to get to camp  at around 6 hours 20 minutes or so. Not too bad.
[14:40] Right, this is base camp. Beautiful views  over here, isn’t it? Look at that – gorgeous.
[14:46] And a lovely cup of Earl Grey. A lovely cup of  
[14:48] Earl Grey and a lovely wife  to greet me. Earl Grey tea.
[14:54] I’m wearing the right shirt and we’re at  the right event for some Earl Grey tea.  
[14:59] Victoria’s got me a Calippo, which is  very nice. I’ve had loads to drink.
[15:03] I can’t stomach food at the moment – it’s  too hot for food. My mouth is too dry.
[15:12] Quite a few people are staying overnight here,  
[15:16] doing 50 km today and 50 km  tomorrow. "How are you getting on?"
[15:30] "It’s a bit hot."
[15:31] "We’ve got your ice cream, so..."
[15:32] "Yeah, I’ve got me lolly, I’m all right.  Great stuff, thank you very much."
[15:37] I think it’s time to go. We’re  going to wander out slowly. I  
[15:45] wouldn’t mind... I wouldn’t mind just  going to sleep in one of those tents.
[15:48] "Now then, what’s your name?"
[16:03] "Victoria."
[16:04] "Victoria? You live in Belgium?"
[16:05] "I live in Belgium."
[16:06] "I’m Scottish, obviously."
[16:08] "Okay, so you’re Scottish, you  live in Belgium and now you..."
[16:11] "I drove 2 hours to France, got a ferry for 2  hours, then drove another 2 hours to run 100 km."
[16:18] "And why are you here?"
[16:21] "That’s a very good question.  I’m starting to forget that."
[16:24] "Why, at the moment?"
[16:26] "It’s because, in Belgium, the 100 km races,  they’re just not accessible. They’re really  
[16:31] for the elite and you have to run a certain  pace. It’s quite intimidating to show up. So  
[16:35] something like this is... really cool  for everybody and really welcoming."
[16:40] "Have you felt that this  event is female-friendly?"
[16:44] "Yes, absolutely. But it’s friendly  for all levels. You don’t need to...  
[16:49] and even the faster guys, as  they pass me, everybody’s like,  
[16:53] 'well done, keep it up,' to support  each other. Yeah, it’s been great."
[16:58] "Is this your first time doing this race, though?"
[17:01] "I did it in 2019."
[17:04] "Cool."
[17:04] "I thought I would never do it again."
[17:06] "Is your plan to beat your time from last time?"
[17:08] "Yeah, that would be nice, but honestly,  
[17:11] just see what happens. No expectations is the  way I try to do it, but it would be nice."
[17:15] "Well, good luck."
[17:16] "Thank you, take care."
[17:19] Threshold Events have made a positive effort  to increase the number of female participants  
[17:24] at this year’s Race to the Stones and  were hoping for a 50/50 gender split.  
[17:29] They got very close, with 1,033 women completing  the non-stop 100 km and 1,037 male finishers.
[17:39] So, we’ve made it to pit stop five, which  is 58 km. We’ve got a marathon to go,  
[17:45] so it’s always good to get  to a marathon to go in an  
[17:48] ultra. Feeling a little bit better  than I did at the halfway point.
[18:01] Another ridiculously well-stocked aid  station. We’ve got flat Coke here.  
[18:06] How often do you actually get flat...? I  mean, it’s genuinely flat Coke. Crisps,  
[18:12] popcorn, cashew nuts. Look, Skittles, Haribo...
[18:19] A big thank you to all of you who stopped to  say hello during the race. It’s really nice to  
[18:24] meet people who watch the channel. If you ever  see me at an event, please come and say hello.
[18:30] "I do like your videos."
[18:31] "Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate that."
[18:32] "You’re on camera – you can say that on camera."
[18:34] "I love your videos."
[18:36] "Thank you very much."
[18:38] So, apparently, it’s 14 km to  the next aid station and 14 km,  
[18:42] actually, to the next time I see Victoria. So,  
[18:45] it might be that Victoria is exactly where the  next aid station is – 58 km. A marathon to go.
[19:06] If you’re enjoying the video, you know what to do.  If you’re not subscribed, please subscribe to the  
[19:10] Film My Run channel. Yeah, click that like button.  Share it with your friends, although try not to  
[19:15] share too much of my chest with your friends  – I apologise for this. It’s just hot, okay?
[19:24] I’m supposed to be advertising this lovely  Flying Burrito shirt, but it’s so hot,  
[19:29] I’ve had to unzip it. But if you  do want a Flying Burrito shirt,  
[19:32] the link is in the description for a discount on  this colour. Or you can get red, green, or a mauve  
[19:40] colour. They also do paisley shirts, and they’re  proper tech shirts. They wick the sweat away,  
[19:49] flap around nicely, and are very comfortable.  So, discount in the description below.
[19:57] Up to this point, Lee and I had run  together on and off for most of the race,  
[20:02] but between 60 and 70 km, as it started  to cool down and I began to feel better,  
[20:08] I could see the finish line beckoning.  I pushed on a little. Since I wasn’t  
[20:13] carrying a head torch, I wanted to  make sure I finished before dark.
[20:19] 62 km into Race to the Stones, we’re  just coming down off Whitehorse Hill  
[20:25] now. Over there is a white horse  carved into the side of the hill,  
[20:33] hence the name. And there’s also a castle,  apparently – the footprint of a castle up  
[20:40] there – but we’re not going to visit it. This is  not a tourist day – this is a very serious race.
[20:50] The entire route of Race to the Stones is  completely runnable. Oddly, the further I  
[20:55] got into the race, the more I felt like running.  Early on, I’d been cautious not to go too fast.  
[21:02] During the middle part of the race, it was too hot  and there were lots of walking breaks. But as the  
[21:08] heat of the day gradually dissipated, I started  to feel good, and I was really enjoying the run.
[21:14] It’s always satisfying in the second half of  a race to slowly reel in the runner ahead,  
[21:21] pass them, and then lock onto the  next one. I was wearing my Hoka  
[21:26] carbon-plated Skyward X road shoes  – the second time I’ve used these  
[21:31] for a long race – and they were so  comfortable on this easy terrain.
[21:36] 71 km in 9 hours 35 minutes. We  are just approaching pit stop six.
[21:46] "Go on, then. I might have a tomato. I’ve just  had a bit of watermelon, some orange, some melon,  
[21:59] a Rebel Ignite maple syrup gel – amazingly enough,  
[22:04] I never take gels, but I’m going to  try this one. Cup of tea, Red Bull,  
[22:11] and a cup of milk as well. So, a multitude of  different liquids down my throat and a tomato."
[22:20] We’ve had a few little things.  We’ll see how we get on. I’m just  
[22:24] going to walk out for the next half  a kilometre, just in case I throw up.
[22:30] Having a good time, actually.  Enjoying it. It feels like  
[22:32] we’re approaching something near the  end now – less than 20 miles to go.
[22:42] I believe this is the M4. Once the food and  various drinks had settled in my stomach, I  
[22:51] was back running again. It was cool enough now for  me to finally zip my shirt back up. You can see  
[22:58] the dark clouds in the sky, and at one point  on the Ridge, it actually started to feel cold.
[23:05] By the way, if you’d like to try any  of the Protein Rebel Maple Ignite gels,  
[23:10] which seem to be the only gels that I can stomach,  
[23:14] then you can get 15% off an order using  the code in the description below.
[23:20] Nearly 50 miles in, 10 hours 52 minutes. We’ve  had some good running down off the Ridge.
[23:28] I don’t know whether it was that gel I had,  the watermelon, the cup of tea, the Red Bull,  
[23:35] or just the temperature going down, but we’ve  had some weather. It started raining lightly  
[23:41] – just enough to cool everything  down, and I’ve been able to run,  
[23:45] so it’s been really good. We’ve done some  good kilometres coming down off the Ridge.
[23:57] Although, you’re earthbound,  right? Just before 83 km.
[24:03] "6 hours 32 minutes – 11 hours  into the run. Is that right?"
[24:09] "Yeah."
[24:09] "7:30 – a bit slow, isn’t it?"
[24:13] "Rubbish."
[24:14] You were made so amongst the clouds but never  learned to rise above these crowns stuck in  
[24:28] the dust of the life that you found with nowhere  to go – no higher ground. Even if you’ve never  
[24:43] come before, you can take a chance, dance, and try  once more. Don’t let your worries weigh you down;  
[25:01] you can still take life,  although you’re earthbound.
[25:11] 90 km done. 12 hours 4 minutes. Top of the  Ridge again – now we’ve just had a big climb.  
[25:19] Feeling strong though. Running well today.  Well, in the second half, anyway. I mean,  
[25:24] I’d like to get it done. I’m tired, but,  you know, considering, I feel pretty good.
[25:30] It really is amazing what a difference  the temperature makes to my running,  
[25:35] and I’m sure some of you watching will  be able to relate. It was so much cooler,  
[25:40] and there had been some rain, which, along  with regular eating and drinking at the crew  
[25:45] stops and aid stations, had just given me that  spring in my step from 60 to 95 km. However,  
[25:54] approaching 95 km, I could definitely  feel myself flagging somewhat.
[26:00] Right, that’s 95 km done. Pretty tired  now. I’d quite like it to be finished,  
[26:08] but I’m pleased with how I’ve run in the  second half, and we are going to get in  
[26:12] without needing the head torch. Not that  I’ve got my head torch, but I won’t need it.
[26:27] "Hold on, buddy, just keep it going."
[26:33] Race to the Stones is very well  signposted. There’s virtually no  
[26:37] chance of going wrong. I still  had the GPX map on my watch,  
[26:41] though, and towards the end, I got  a very strange audio instruction:
[26:48] "In 2.4 km, make a U-turn."
[26:50] "In 2.4 km, make a U-turn."
[26:54] What’s she on about? It wouldn’t be long before  I found out exactly what she was on about.
[27:00] Okay, in the worst mind game ever, just as we  get to Avebury Stone Circle – which is just  
[27:07] here – there’s a cone, and we have to turn around  the cone and go exactly back the way we came,  
[27:13] which is hilarious. But this is Avebury Stone  Circle, which I’ve never been to before.
[27:21] "We’ll see you at the finish line."
[27:23] Again, thank you, guys, appreciate you being here.
[27:28] "Thanks a lot."
[27:31] That’s how stone circles should  be. You should be allowed to jump  
[27:34] on them when you’re a kid. Not so with Stonehenge.
[27:40] I am very tired, but we have a mile  to go. Let’s start running, I suppose.
[27:46] "Well done, you."
[27:49] "And you." "What’s your name?"
[27:49] "Mary."
[27:50] "Mary. Where are you from?"
[27:53] "Spain."
[27:54] "Ah, lovely. Why did you come to this race?"
[27:57] "Everyone recommends this one, so why not?"
[28:01] "And have you enjoyed it?"
[28:02] "I love it. I was about to leave it  halfway, but now, I’m so glad I didn’t."
[28:08] "You’re glad?"
[28:08] "I’m so grateful that I didn’t  give up, yeah, it’s amazing."
[28:11] "Well done."
[28:12] "Congratulations. You too."
[28:13] "Thank you."
[28:18] Now, according to my watch,  I’ve just hit 100 km. Actually,  
[28:23] I’ve got two watches on – one of them says  I’ve hit 100 km, the other says 99.83.
[28:58] I’ve been able to hear the finish line from  right up the top of that hill over there,  
[28:58] and then we had to come all the way past the  finish line to the stone circle, turn around,  
[28:58] and come back again. So, it’s been torture  the last 3 or 4 km, hearing that finish line.
[28:58] Look at the sun just coming over the  hill over there – absolutely beautiful.
[28:59] "Well done, Mary."
[29:00] "Thank you."
[29:11] Wow, look at that. 600 metres to  the finish line. The sun has come  
[29:15] out for us to cross the finish  line – how fantastic is that?
[29:21] So, let’s do this. Race to the Stones –  thoroughly enjoyed it. A bit disappointed  
[29:28] about the litter on the floor. I recommend  Threshold do some education for their  
[29:35] runners around not dropping litter on  the course, or even go further and say  
[29:42] if anybody is found dropping litter, they  face a DQ or time penalty or something.
[29:49] But other than that – fantastic. Really enjoyed it  and very pleased with my second half. Managed to  
[29:57] run strong in the second half. Don’t know  why – combination of reasons, probably.
[30:06] I never wanted to do Race to the Stones before,  
[30:08] but I’m so glad I did. And I can see why  it is a classic UK ultra. Looking back,  
[30:15] my favourite thing about the race was not having  to carry any mandatory kit. It gave me such  
[30:20] a sense of freedom and self-determination, and I  will definitely come back and do it again one day.
[30:37] Stephen Cousins. "What up, Stephen?" Here we go.
[30:50] "Thank you."
[31:04] I was hoping my wife would be here… Oh  well, I’m sure she’s around somewhere.
[31:12] "Oh, you just missed me, I’ve literally  just come in about 30 seconds ago."
[31:18] Such a bad signal on my phone,  we were speaking to Ellis.
[31:29] I’ve got burger and chips. I’ve  just noticed, over on my right,  
[31:36] there’s a pamper area. It’s  literally called a pamper area.
[31:44] And I’m waiting for the posh wash  showers. It’s the day after Race  
[31:52] to the Stones. We’ve gone on a  bit of a sightseeing tour today.
[31:55] This morning, we went to see  Avebury Stone Circle, where we  
[31:58] finished the race yesterday. And this  afternoon, we’ve come to Stonehenge.
[32:02] Haven’t been here for ages – it’s  absolutely packed. Loads of people.
[32:07] Enjoyed the race yesterday. Pity about the litter.  
[32:10] Ran really well in the second half – the  first half got a bit tired in the heat.
[32:15] There’s the medal – it’s not bad! Thank  you very much to the guys at Race to the  
[32:20] Stones for inviting me along. Thank  you to Flying Burrito for the awesome  
[32:24] shirt. If you want a shirt, there  is a link in the description below.
[32:28] Thank you to Vega for the hat – again,  
[32:31] I’ll put a link in the description below  if you want to get yourself a Vega hat too.
[32:36] Blimey! Rebel Ignite – the gels that I tried  yesterday actually worked! I’ve never had a  
[32:42] gel that worked so well. So, thank you to the  guys at Protein Rebel for the Rebel Ignite gels.
[32:48] Right, now we’re doing the  Cape Wrath Ultra series. So,  
[32:51] if you’d like to see Cape Wrath Ultra, episode  two, click that link right there, and that’ll  
[32:56] take you to that video. I will see  you guys on the start line next time.
