[00:02] [Music]
[00:33] how much money do you think you can cat
[00:37] or whatever ever have raised for M&D
[00:39] over the past few years ready ready as
[00:44] I'll ever be
[00:45] good good good have you done a white
[00:46] star event before llama tree so Carolyn
[00:54] is the regular white star sweeper
[00:58] essentially she's going for an 8-hour
[01:00] walk today right seven and a half and
[01:05] look she's a sweeper because she's see
[01:08] it's all very organized
[01:18] [Music]
[01:27] welcome to film my run there's a good to
[01:31] 300 of us here for the inaugural crafty
[01:35] Fox madman by white star running we all
[01:37] know white star running giant head
[01:39] maryland's llama tree marathon bad cow
[01:43] marathon all these beautiful events
[01:45] around Dorset and we're doing another
[01:47] one today tulips in the course it is
[01:49] hilly it's gonna take a while but we're
[01:52] going to enjoy it
[02:00] [Music]
[02:25] [Music]
[02:31] [Music]
[02:33] tell me who you are I am
[02:36] yeah I'm Richard Palmer and I'm dying
[02:38] today hey ultra-trail Montblanc ten
[02:44] miles off climb basically yeah this is
[02:50] flat I thank you very much
[02:58] [Music]
[03:08] to K in and we're down to a walk already
[03:10] it is going to be a hilly course
[03:15] [Music]
[03:32] how's it going Chris yeah well good so
[03:36] Chris finished South Downs Way with me
[03:38] where he sprinted off at the end to be
[03:40] on his left beat the dead
[03:42] that's females where yeah well enjoy it
[03:46] today for you 26 26 miles 26 marathon
[03:53] [Music]
[04:06] so the crafty Fox marathon is two loops
[04:10] of the course and we are now halfway
[04:15] through the first loop in one hour and
[04:18] eight minutes having climbed 300 meters
[04:21] of ascent so it's looking like the whole
[04:24] thing is gonna be about 1,200 meters of
[04:26] ascent second water stuff on the crafty
[04:50] Fox mouthing with 13 kilometers in till
[04:52] 8 to go to the end of the loop
[04:56] a lovely views of Milton Ave a school
[05:02] over there
[05:03] [Music]
[05:18] [Music]
[05:23] third aid station on the crafty Fox look
[05:26] there food for us to enjoy lovely views
[05:30] 17 kilometers in so given that this is a
[05:33] white style then could be for could be
[05:36] five kilometers to the turn around who
[05:37] knows
[05:40] give him this his down hill on the road
[05:43] I should be running but I'm eating cake
[05:44] instead hi guys
[05:47] ginger cake
[05:50] [Music]
[06:06] so in true white star fashion we are now
[06:10] well over a half mouthing two hours 23
[06:14] minutes 21 point two three kilometers
[06:16] and no sign of the turnaround just yet
[06:21] right so we are now halfway at twenty
[06:26] two point three K so it's definitely
[06:28] over a marathon but not actually as far
[06:30] as I was expecting it might
[06:32] [Music]
[06:46] along the route here believe it or not
[06:49] is a guestbook in a box that you can
[06:51] sign look it's the Dorset Gap book
[06:57] [Music]
[07:08] this is really a strong spring you don't
[07:11] let it go
[07:13] [Music]
[07:34] what's your favorite way starting
[07:36] they've done um I really like Huffington
[07:39] bad cows do it I'll do the first of all
[07:41] day
[07:42] yeah no just are so well organized so on
[07:47] our first loop this was the first aid
[07:50] station is now the fifth aid stations
[07:55] [Music]
[08:16] another steep hill 900 meters climbed
[08:20] and done about 20 miles so i say another
[08:30] seven or eight to go
[08:33] [Music]
[08:48] crafty Fox is a very very course so
[08:51] you'll get fields woods like this you
[08:57] get tarmac gravel track chalk track this
[09:01] time of year it's not muddy so you could
[09:04] get away with road shoes
[09:06] but it's certainly not easy by the time
[09:10] we finish this there'll be 1,200 meters
[09:11] of elevation and the they're going
[09:14] underfoot although it's not muddy can be
[09:18] tricky on your ankles lots of holes
[09:22] uneven ground so you do need to watch
[09:24] yourself lots of beautiful views bit
[09:29] overcast today but on a really sunny day
[09:31] be absolutely amazing really well
[09:33] signposted as are all the white star
[09:36] events see not many go wrong
[09:39] [Music]
[09:53] okay it's effectively the finalized -
[09:56] you've got five K to go home
[09:58] [Music]
[10:04] [Music]
[10:26] couple of kilometers before the end and
[10:29] they make you run in the ploughed field
[10:31] quite tired now but we're nearly there
[10:37] there's the campsite in the distance 44
[10:41] kilometers done
[10:45] [Music]
[11:25] [Music]
[11:37] [Music]
[11:40] right it's not been boiling hot but
[11:42] that's kind of been a good thing because
[11:44] the hills have been killers today 1200
[11:47] meters of a cent one Z&F over here look
[11:52] lots of tired legs that is it from the
[11:56] crafty Fox marathon the heart marathon
