I didn't respect the mountain.

Looking back, that's the simplest way to explain what happened at CCC 2018. I'd done ultras before. I'd climbed hills. I thought I knew what I was getting into. But Mont Blanc doesn't care what you think you know. It has a way of teaching humility, and my education began about ten kilometres in.

## The Pilgrimage to Chamonix

There is a place, a mystical, magical place known only to ultra runners. A Mecca, if you will. For one week in August, the greatest ultra runners in the world convene in Chamonix to run races from 15km up to 300km, circumnavigating the highest mountain in Western Europe.

As an ultra runner with a young family, every holiday has a race attached to it. And ergo, every race becomes a family holiday. We spent the early part of our week in Chamonix doing the tourist things — riding the cable car, hiking up the side of Mont Blanc, messing about on the lake. And then my two children, who regularly resist our attempts to get them up for parkrun on a Saturday morning, decided they wanted to run 5km down from a glacier. 800 metres of descent, just for fun. Kids, eh?

Whilst visiting the Running Expo, they were fortunate enough to meet and interview one of the race favourites, Jim Walmsley. "How far do you run in your races?" my daughter asked him. "But you also do parkrun?" It was brilliant.

## The Terrifying Kit Check

Unless you've done it, you have absolutely no idea how terrifying pre-race mandatory kit check and number collection can be. Honestly, have I remembered everything? Two head torches? Taped seams on my jacket? Have I got my ID? Did I remember to pack that extra layer? What if my gloves aren't waterproof enough? Will I be disqualified before I even get to the start line?

It's genuinely anxiety-inducing. You queue up, lay out all your kit, and wait for the volunteers to inspect every item while your heart pounds in your chest. The relief when they hand you that race number is palpable.

Part of what makes the UTMB so unique is its system of entry. You can't just rock up on the day and pay your money. You can't even go to the website and sign up. You have to qualify through a series of races over several years, accumulating points. And even when you've got enough points, you enter a ballot — it could take three years before your name gets drawn. So when you finally get that bib, it means something.

## The Bus Through the Tunnel

It's 6:20 in the morning. We're in the queue at Place du Mont Blanc to get the bus through the tunnel to Courmayeur. Start time is 9am. I've got my porridge, I've got some coffee, and we're all good.

It's a nervous time, early in the morning on the bus to a race. There's nothing to do but contemplate what the day might hold.

Courmayeur is lovely — like a mirror image of Chamonix on the Italian side of Mont Blanc. It comes at around 70km into the full UTMB 100-mile race, so the town knows ultra runners well. Time seemed to stand still during that slow walk to the start line. The atmosphere was incredible. They really ramp it up.

## The First Climb Destroys Me

We started as though we were running a 10k race, which in hindsight was foolish. Looking at the footage, the first few hundred metres are actually downhill — which I completely forgot about once we started climbing.

Literally ten minutes into the race and we'd begun the ascent. Loads of people were still running up the hill. My guess is they were all full of adrenaline, not really thinking about how that was going to tire them out at 90km. So I swallowed my pride and walked.

At 1,300 metres climbed, that first hill had just killed me. Only 10km in, two hours gone, and I was absolutely shattered. And we still had all that to go up there — you could see the trail snaking further up the mountain.

By the top of the first climb — 10.66km, 2 hours 17 minutes, 1,434 metres of elevation — I was beginning to question whether I'd complete the course at all. My original goal had been 20 hours. That now seemed laughable.

## Crisis of Confidence

At 20km, just over 3 hours 44 minutes in, I was suffering a genuine crisis of confidence. I hadn't accounted for how steep and long that first climb would be. I'd probably gone off too quickly, pushed by the pressure of single-track trails with runners behind me going faster than I should.

I'd got to the top of that climb genuinely shattered. And I'd only done 20k. Got 80 to go.

It's such a beautiful place, isn't it? But I was now dreading every climb, and everybody was passing me. One thing that kept my spirits up was the scenery. I've run in some great places, but this was something else entirely.

## Old Friends and New

The ultra running community is really quite small. You can travel all over the world and not be surprised to bump into somebody you know. Sure enough, I ran into Dave Ross from Thames Meander Marathon, running with a torn meniscus and damaged cartilage but determined to finish. And Ian, who I knew from Transvulcania — we'd both done that race three times. "What do you reckon?" I asked him. "Transv is just brutal from the start," he said. "This is spread out. I think it'll make it a bit easier."

So I just needed to chill out a bit.

## Three Countries, One Race

After the first two aid stations at Bertone and Bonatti, there's a short downhill section and then you cross the border from Italy into Switzerland. By 28.5km, over 5 hours in, I was having coffee, bread, cheese, and soup, recovering before pressing on.

It was going to be one step in front of the other today. Just get to the end, any time we can.

As we climbed towards Grand Col Ferret — 2,537 metres, the highest point of the day — the clouds rolled in. I guarantee there was an absolutely beautiful view in every direction. I just couldn't see any of it.

The descent from Grand Col Ferret to La Fouly reminded me of home — the weather, the terrain underfoot, all very similar to the South Downs where I run. By now I was starting to feel like I was getting into the race a little bit.

## Halfway at La Fouly

Marathon distance covered. 42k. 8 hours 23 minutes. For a marathon. Let that sink in.

At La Fouly, I had soup, cheese, dark chocolate, and gave my legs a bit of a massage. My stomach was feeling queasy, so I needed to settle it before the next section.

At halfway — 50km, 9 hours 51 minutes — I did some quick maths. If I kept the same pace for the second half, I'd come in under 20 hours. But with three big climbs still to go? Not sure it's going to happen. But we'll just keep on going. I'm not as despondent as I was earlier.

## The Reroute

What I didn't know when I entered was that this year's CCC would be different from any before it. Earlier in the week, a fatal rockfall had claimed the life of a hiker on the usual route. The organisers had no choice but to reroute the final section.

The result was a course that became a series of shorter, intense climbs followed by technical downhill and singletrack. Not easier — just different. And for someone with already-trashed legs, that technical terrain was brutal.

By Trient, at 72km, I knew that barring disaster I was going to finish. But it wasn't going to be in 20 hours. That dream had died somewhere around the 30km mark.

## The Final Push

Look what we've got to negotiate at the end of this race. Nine and a half k to go and it's not runnable at all. Just rocks, rocky roots, horrific terrain — especially on completely trashed legs.

My watch hit 100km, but there should only be 6k to go. Everything's longer than they say. It's going to be at least seven, if not eight more kilometres.

If you've suffered in an ultra, you'll know that feeling of longing for the last aid station to appear. We were waiting for La Flégère at 1,900 metres. Would it ever come?

Finally past that aid station. I didn't stop. Just want to get home now.

As a final reminder of who's really in charge, the mountain kept me climbing longer than I'd expected and time was running out. The 20-hour goal had gone long ago. Now even 24 hours was slipping away.

I had to run.

## Under 24 Hours

We're going to make it under 24 hours. Not the original goal, but it'll do.

Crossing that finish line felt strange. I didn't really take it in because I'd been trying so hard to get under 24 hours. I was just relieved it was over.

**23 hours, 57 minutes, 30 seconds.**

I didn't respect Mont Blanc. I thought it would be easy business. It's been really, really hard. I should have trained harder. I should have realised how tough those hills were going to be.

But we got it done. And we'll come back again and do it better next time.

## The Festival Continues

Just a few hours later, I was in the crowd to welcome home Xavier Thévenard, the UTMB winner for 2018 — his third victory at the 170km race. He's also the only person to have won the UTMB, the CCC, the TDS, and the 55km OCC race. Extraordinary.

It was an absolute pleasure to see Britain's Damian Hall finally break the top ten at UTMB, finishing fifth. And a massive well done to Tom Evans, who won my race, the CCC, and to Harry Jones who came eighth.

## What I Learned

UTMB races are different. The organisation is impeccable — from the volunteers, to the food, to the way aid stations are run, to the support along the course. They've been doing this for 15 years and they've really got it down to a T.

But don't let the slick organisation fool you into thinking the race itself will be easy. Mont Blanc demands respect. The mountains are bigger than you think, steeper than you expect, and longer than seems possible.

If you can get in and out of a checkpoint quickly, great. But if you need to use an aid station, use it. Rest, eat, mentally recover in preparation for the next part of your race. That's what they're there for.

I finished the 2018 CCC. Couldn't make 20 hours. 23:57 was the best I could do. But that experience — watching my goals slip away, digging deep to salvage something from the race, learning what these mountains are truly capable of — that was my real education.

Three years later, I'd use those lessons at the Val d'Aran 100, where finishing earned me automatic entry to the full UTMB 100 in Chamonix. And eventually, I'd stand on that start line and complete the big one.

But it all started here, in 2018, getting humbled by a mountain that doesn't care what you think you know.
