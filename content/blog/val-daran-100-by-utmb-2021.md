That was the hardest race I have ever, ever done.

I've said those words before, and I'll probably say them again. But standing in the finish area in Vielha, having just spent nearly 47 hours traversing the Spanish Pyrenees, I meant it more than I'd ever meant anything. This was a different level of suffering.

## Before the Start

The Val d'Aran 100 was the inaugural running of this race - a brand new addition to the UTMB World Series. In true UTMB style, the start/finish line was set up right next to a quaint little village church in Vielha. Everything was compacted into a few metres - registration, bib collection, the information point, and the presentation area all within touching distance of each other.

What made this race particularly special was the prize for finishing: automatic entry to the UTMB 100 in Chamonix. No ballot, no lottery, no hoping your name gets pulled out. Just finish this beast of a race and you're in. That carrot was dangling in front of me for the next two days.

An hour and twenty minutes before the start, I handed in my drop bag - the one I'd pick up at around 100km. Spare kit, food, things I might need for the second half. It was really, really hot, and I was very nervous. Really nervous, I have to say.

100 miles. 10,000 metres of ascent. 48 hours to do it. The numbers alone were intimidating enough.

## The Inevitable UTMB Bottleneck

If you've ever done a UTMB race anywhere in the world, you'll know what happens next. We're only four and a half kilometres in, and there are so many people that we've basically come to a complete standstill. Nearly a thousand runners all trying to filter through narrow mountain trails. It happens at every UTMB race, and Val d'Aran was no exception.

But once we got moving again, the views opened up. The first checkpoint came at 11 kilometres - two hours and six minutes in, with 800 metres already climbed. And what a view. At 14 kilometres, standing at the top of the first climb, I could see Aneto - the highest point in mainland Spain - rising up in the distance. Absolutely amazing, especially with the sun still up.

## Into the Night

By six hours and 37 minutes, I'd reached the third aid station. It was half past midnight, and the station was closing in about 35 minutes - so we weren't too far inside the cutoff. I grabbed some soup and bread, knowing there was a very big, long climb ahead.

The pattern was establishing itself: climb, descend, climb again. At five to three in the morning, I could see the first hints of dawn starting to break. We'd done 38 kilometres in almost nine hours.

By 50 kilometres - nearly 12 hours in - I was well over a quarter of the way there. Almost a third. I didn't feel too bad at that point, just starting to get tired with all these climbs. We'd had some really tough ones, but we were getting there.

## The Quads Start to Go

At 57 kilometres, I stopped at Bossost for pasta and black coffee. And that's when I noticed it - my quads had got properly trashed on the downhill into the aid station. I'd been there almost half an hour, which was too long really. Thirteen hours and 29 minutes on the clock. Time to get moving.

The next section took us to Canejan at 64 kilometres, and then... the monster climb. The big one. A 1,500-metre ascent up the side of a mountain.

At 17 hours 55 minutes, we began that climb. There was a beautiful blue lake below us, and we were 75 kilometres in. The heat was brutal. Every time we came across a little stream, we were all throwing ourselves under it to keep cool.

## Halfway - 20 Hours In

Twenty hours and 24 minutes into the Val d'Aran 100, we'd covered 80 kilometres. Halfway. It seemed amazing that it was only halfway, but there we were.

This wasn't really a run anymore. It was more of a long, slow hike. But the scenery was fantastic - mountain passes, glaciers forming streams and waterfalls that tumbled down into the valleys below.

Coming down from one pass, I could look back up and see the V-shape at the top where we'd just descended from. 95 kilometres done, 25 hours and 11 minutes on the clock. And my quads were absolutely shot. Running downhill had become really, really painful. I could manage the flat, I could make my way slowly uphill, but descending was agony. And we still had 65 kilometres to go.

## The Second Night

As the sun went down for the second time, I made my way to the drop bag station at 103 kilometres. I was very, very tired. Rapidly losing patience with this race. So hard.

I got changed, ate some food, prepared for the night section. Although "prepared" is a strong word - I was absolutely shattered. And the news filtering through the aid station wasn't encouraging: apparently over 300 people had already withdrawn. DNF'd. It was a beast of a race, and it was breaking people.

Looking around, there weren't many runners left. I was going to be on my own on the hills tonight.

## Sunrise, Sickness, and Stubbornness

The sun came up for the second time and I felt sick. Properly sick. I'd had enough of this race. Still 20 miles to go.

You can't deny it was beautiful though. But having been up for two nights now, stomach feeling funny, feet hurting, legs completely trashed, and the gnarliest course I'd ever seen in my life... I was not feeling it.

Then, like an idiot - as I always do - I failed to look at the information correctly. I thought the aid station I was at was the one with the 12:45 cutoff. It was actually the next one. But we had three hours to get there: a little climb, then 968 metres straight down. My mate Dai reckoned we could do it. I reckoned we could do it too.

## Making the Final Cutoff

Good news - we made it to the final aid station with a cutoff time, and we made it with an hour to spare. All we needed to do now was eat, figure out how to stay cool for the final section, and get it done. One aid station in the middle, a big climb, a little climb, then downhill into Vielha for the finish.

The final climb was standard fare for the past two days: trudging up a mountain, very slowly, through a forest, eventually coming out into open land with the higher peaks visible in the distance. We'd done this about four times over the course of the race. But this was the last one.

## The Finish

Three and a half kilometres to go. I could see Vielha down below. But my legs were absolutely rock solid. I could hardly move.

"From the United Kingdom, well done Stephen!"

What a wonderful feeling, crossing that finish line. 46 hours, 51 minutes.

"Ring that bell Stephen, ring that bell! You made it home. Stephen's coming home. Football's coming home."

That was the hardest race I have ever, ever done. I'm just so glad to be back home.

## The Aftermath

Finishing Val d'Aran earned me something I'd been chasing for years: automatic entry to the UTMB 100 in Chamonix. No more lottery, no more hoping. I was in.

Two years later, I'd stand on that start line in Chamonix and complete the full UTMB 100. But that's another story.

For now, standing in Vielha with legs that could barely hold me up, having survived two nights in the Pyrenees, having watched over 300 runners drop out around me, having thrown myself into mountain streams just to cope with the heat - I'd done it.

The hardest race I have ever done. And completely worth it.
