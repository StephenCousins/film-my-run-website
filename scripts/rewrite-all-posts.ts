// Post 212: Manchester Marathon 2023
const post212Content = `<p>Two weeks before Manchester, I'd run Paris in 2:55:42. A solid sub-3, conservatively paced, feeling strong at the finish. That race had gone exactly to plan. Manchester was going to be different.</p>

<p>The plan - if you can call it that - was to run the first half at half marathon pace and see what happened. In hindsight, this was either brave or stupid. Probably stupid.</p>

<h2>The Second Largest Marathon in the UK</h2>

<p>The adidas Manchester Marathon attracts over 28,000 runners, making it second only to London. The course passes Old Trafford football ground (not the cricket one - that's the finish), weaves through Chorlton, Sale, and Altrincham, and is marketed as "the UK's fastest, flattest, and friendliest major marathon."</p>

<p>The flattest part is debatable. I was about to discover that.</p>

<h2>The Kamikaze Opening</h2>

<p>I started at just over four minutes per kilometre - 2:50 pace. Every voice of experience was screaming that this was too fast. Two weeks after a marathon. No taper. Residual fatigue still heavy in my legs. And to make things worse, I'd decided to run the entire race without any nutrition at all.</p>

<p>Not even the half a banana and fizzy drink I'd taken in Paris. Nothing.</p>

<p>Halfway came in 1:25:30. I was tired. I knew the second half would hurt. But some stubborn part of my brain refused to ease off.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2023/manchester-marathon-03.jpg" alt="Grinding through the Manchester streets" /></figure>

<h2>The Hills Nobody Mentions</h2>

<p>The organisers' claim that Manchester is the flattest marathon in the UK is, I discovered, a complete fallacy. The bridges over the canal at Timperley, the climb approaching Altrincham, the undulations that seem to appear from nowhere when your legs are gone - none of these are flat.</p>

<p>At 30km, I was two hours and one minute in. Still technically on for sub-3 if I could hold it together. But the wheels were coming off.</p>

<h2>The Long, Slow Unravelling</h2>

<p>35km: "Really hurting now. I am slowing down drastically."</p>

<p>That last ten kilometres was as brutal as any I've run. When you're positive splitting this badly, everyone seems to be passing you. You want to respond, to find something, to dig into reserves that simply aren't there. But your body has made its decision, and all you can do is grind.</p>

<p>Luke passed me with about a mile to go. "Come on!" he shouted. I had nothing left to give.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2023/manchester-marathon-02.jpg" alt="The finish at Old Trafford cricket ground" /></figure>

<h2>The Verdict: 2:57:44</h2>

<p>Despite everything, I crossed the line in 2:57:44. My second sub-3 marathon in two weeks. Objectively, that's a good result. But it didn't feel good. The execution was awful - going out at 2:50 pace and finishing at 2:57 is textbook positive splitting.</p>

<p>There's probably a happy medium between conservative pacing and kamikaze mode. I just haven't found it yet.</p>

<p>What I have found is that running a marathon without fuel, two weeks after another marathon, on too-fast opening splits, is a recipe for suffering. Not failure - I still got that sub-3 - but suffering that turns the final hour into a death march.</p>

<p>Ignas Brasevicius won the men's race in 2:16:27. He probably didn't feel as bad as I did.</p>

// Post 213: Cape Wrath Ultra Day 4 2024
const post213Content = `<p>By Day 4 of the Cape Wrath Ultra, the field had thinned dramatically. A combination of punishing terrain, the Scottish weather, and an unwelcome guest - the norovirus - had reduced the starting field of 172 runners to around 140. Those of us still going had survived the first two days of sunshine and heat, then the brutal Day 3 slog from Kinloch Hourn to Achnashellach.</p>

<p>Day 4 was supposed to be shorter. It wasn't going to be easier.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/cape-wrath-day4-01.jpg" alt="Cape Wrath Ultra Day 4 - Scottish Highlands" /></figure>

<h2>The Cape Wrath Ultra</h2>

<p>For those who don't know it, the Cape Wrath Ultra is Scotland's premier multi-stage ultra running event. 400 kilometres from Fort William to Cape Wrath over 8 days, winding through Knoydart, Kintail, Torridon, Assynt, and Sutherland. Five of those days are proper ultra marathons over mountainous terrain. It's described as running through "the world's most inspirational landscapes," and for once, the marketing doesn't exaggerate.</p>

<p>The 2024 edition, however, will be remembered for something else entirely: the vomiting bug.</p>

<div class="strava-embed-placeholder" data-embed-type="activity" data-embed-id="11612024442" data-style="standard" data-from-embed="false"></div><script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>

<h2>Day 4: Finding a Rhythm</h2>

<p>After the monster that was Day 3 - 68 kilometres with over 2,300 metres of climbing - Day 4 offered something resembling relief. Shorter distance, but don't let that fool you. The terrain was rough, technical, and featured that special Scottish specialty: heather bashing.</p>

<p>The cooler weather was a blessing after the brutal heat of the opening days. I found myself settling into something approaching a rhythm, moving steadily through terrain that would have destroyed me three days earlier but now felt almost manageable. That's the strange magic of multi-day events - your body adapts to things you thought impossible.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/cape-wrath-day4-03.jpg" alt="Stunning views across the Scottish Highlands" /></figure>

<h2>The Invisible Enemy</h2>

<p>The norovirus had been tearing through the camp. At checkpoints, you'd hear stories of runners collapsing, of people vomiting on the trail, of DNFs not from exhaustion but from illness. The finish rate would end up at just 33% for the Ultra category - down from 51% in 2023. That wasn't because the course was harder. It was because something was very, very wrong.</p>

<p>I was one of the lucky ones. Whether through obsessive hand hygiene or pure luck, I avoided the worst of it.</p>

<h2>The Scenery Payoff</h2>

<p>When you're struggling through a multi-day race, it's easy to forget why you entered. Day 4 reminded me. The Scottish Highlands in late May, with the sun occasionally breaking through, with lochs glittering below and mountains rolling into the distance - this is why we do it.</p>

<p>Every aid station felt like a small victory. Every summit offered views that made the suffering worthwhile. And slowly, steadily, the finish line for Day 4 drew closer.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/cape-wrath-day4-02.jpg" alt="Descending through the heather" /></figure>

<h2>Onwards to Cape Wrath</h2>

<p>Day 4 complete. Still in the race. Still moving north towards that lighthouse at the northwestern tip of mainland Britain.</p>

<p>Danny Smith would eventually win the overall race in 50:28:18. Bridget Glaister took the women's title in 59:49:41 after a closely fought battle with Elsa Morgan. For the rest of us, the achievement was simpler: keep moving, stay healthy, reach Cape Wrath.</p>

<p>Four down, four to go.</p>

// Post 214: Race to the Stones 2024
const post214Content = `<p>The Ridgeway is 5,000 years old. People have been walking this route since the Bronze Age, long before Britain was Britain, long before there were roads or cars or GPS watches. And on a July weekend in 2024, I joined 1,589 other runners to follow in those ancient footsteps for 100 kilometres.</p>

<p>Race to the Stones has become one of the most popular ultras in the UK for good reason. It's accessible, it's achievable, and it's absolutely beautiful.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/race-to-the-stones-01.jpg" alt="Race to the Stones 2024 - the Ridgeway" /></figure>

<h2>Britain's Oldest Road</h2>

<p>The Ridgeway runs from Overton Hill near Avebury to Ivinghoe Beacon - Race to the Stones covers most of it, starting near Lewknor in Oxfordshire and finishing at the standing stones of Avebury. Along the way you pass the Uffington White Horse, Iron Age hillforts, ancient burial mounds, and rolling chalk downland that seems unchanged since Neolithic times.</p>

<p>This isn't a course where you battle mountains. It's a course where you commune with history.</p>

<div class="strava-embed-placeholder" data-embed-type="activity" data-embed-id="11882704384" data-style="standard" data-from-embed="false"></div><script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>

<h2>The Threshold Experience</h2>

<p>Threshold Sports, who organise Race to the Stones, have created something special. The aid stations are legendary - not just water and gels, but sandwiches, crisps, fruit, chocolate, and at base camp, actual burgers and pizzas. It's like a four-year-old's birthday party spread across 100 kilometres.</p>

<p>There's no mandatory kit list either, which for an ultra this length is unusual. The regular support means you don't need to carry much, and the completion rate of over 90% reflects how beginner-friendly the race is. That doesn't mean it's easy - 100km is still 100km - but it's achievable for people new to ultra distances.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/race-to-the-stones-03.jpg" alt="Running through ancient landscape" /></figure>

<h2>Mixed British Weather</h2>

<p>The 2024 weather was typically British - mixed, unpredictable, occasionally muddy. But that's part of the charm. You don't come to the Ridgeway expecting Mediterranean conditions. You come expecting an adventure, and the weather delivers character.</p>

<p>Josh Barrow won the men's non-stop race in 7:59:30, just breaking the eight-hour barrier. I finished in 13:18:02 - mid-pack, enjoying the day rather than racing it.</p>

<h2>The Cruel U-Turn</h2>

<p>There's a sting in the tail of Race to the Stones that experienced runners will know and first-timers will curse. With 5km to go, you can see the finish area. You can hear the announcer. You're so close you could almost touch it.</p>

<p>And then the route takes you to Avebury stones... and makes you turn around and come back out again to reach the finish. It's the worst mind game in ultrarunning. Seeing those ancient stones and knowing you can't stop yet is exquisite torture.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/blog/2024/race-to-the-stones-02.jpg" alt="The Avebury Stone Circle" /></figure>

<h2>Worth Every Step</h2>

<p>When you finally do cross that line, 100 kilometres of ancient history behind you, the sense of achievement is immense. The Ridgeway has been carrying travellers for five millennia. For one day, it carried me.</p>

<p>Race to the Stones isn't the hardest ultra I've done. It's not the most technical or the most remote. But it might be the most satisfying. There's something about following in those 5,000-year-old footsteps that puts your own journey into perspective.</p>
