<p>Have you ever considered running without a watch? No, not literally running naked, but leaving your trusty timepiece at home and just enjoying the experience of running without the burden of tracking your pace, heart rate, and other metrics. It may sound crazy, but hear me out.</p>

<p>As runners, we are constantly bombarded with data and numbers. We obsess over our splits, our heart rate zones, and our pacing strategy. It's as if we're wearing a psychological straightjacket that limits our enjoyment of the run. But what if we could break free from this constraint and just run for the pure joy of it?</p>

<p>Recently, I tried running a half marathon without looking at my watch, and it was a liberating experience. Instead of constantly checking my pace, I was able to focus on my surroundings and enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of my experience and why I think every runner should try running without a watch at least once:</p>

<h2>The Straightjacket of a Watch</h2>

<p>We're so used to relying on our watches to dictate our pace and effort level that we forget to listen to our bodies. We train with goal paces in mind and lock into specific paces for different types of runs. We check our heart rate zones to make sure we're in the right zone. We glance down at our watch and adjust our pace accordingly, even if it means deviating from our natural rhythm.</p>

<p>By running without a watch, I was able to break free from this constraint. I had no feedback on how fast or slow I was going, and it was surprisingly liberating. I could focus on my surroundings and enjoy the feeling of running fast without worrying about hitting a specific pace.</p>

<h2>The Mind-Body Connection</h2>

<p>There's a strong connection between our mind and body, and we often forget that they don't function independently. By running without a watch, I was able to reconnect with my body and listen to its cues. I could tell when I was running fast, and I knew when to settle into a comfortable pace.</p>

<p>I also noticed that my effort level remained consistent throughout the race in terms of heart rate. It gradually rose during the race and spiked towards the end when I could smell the finish line. But overall, I was able to maintain a steady effort level without constantly adjusting my pace based on my watch.</p>

<h2>The Freedom to Run Fast</h2>

<p>When we're tied to our watches, we tend to be more conservative in our pacing strategy. We tell ourselves not to be a hero, not to go off too fast, and to stick to the plan. But by running without a watch, I was able to let go of these constraints and just run fast.</p>

<p>I didn't have to worry about hitting a specific pace, so I could start fast and settle into a comfortable rhythm. I could let go of the fear of going too fast and just enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>So, what were the results of running without looking at my watch? Well, I finished the Surrey Half Marathon in 1 hour 24 minutes and 10 seconds, which was faster than I thought I was going. In fact, the last 10k was faster than my official 10K PB of 39 minutes and 43 seconds.</p>

<p>But more importantly, I enjoyed the experience of running without checking the watch every few seconds! I was able to focus on my surroundings and connect with my body. I was able to let go of the burden of tracking my pace and just enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Running without a watch may sound crazy, but it's an experience that every runner should try at least once. By breaking free from the constraints of tracking our pace, we can reconnect with our bodies and enjoy the pure joy of running. We can let go of the fear of going too fast and just run fast for the sheer pleasure of it.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm not suggesting that you should throw away your watch altogether. Tracking your progress and seeing your improvement over time can be incredibly motivating. But by running without a watch every now and then, you can reconnect with the joy of running and remind yourself why you fell in love with the sport in the first place.</p>

<p>So, the next time you lace up your running shoes, why not leave your watch at home and just enjoy the freedom of running without constraints? Who knows, you may surprise yourself with what you're capable of achieving.</p>

<p>My day began at midnight. The gun went off and hundreds of runners began shuffling towards the start gantry in Courmayeur, Italy. I was about to embark on one of the most challenging and beautiful races of my life - the TDS (Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie), a 145km ultra marathon through the Alps.</p>

<p>The TDS is part of the UTMB festival, and while it may not have the prestige of the main UTMB race, it's considered by many to be the most technical and beautiful of all the races. The route takes you through the wild Beaufortain massif, over countless cols and passes, with a total elevation gain of around 9,100m.</p>

<h2>The Start</h2>

<p>Standing at the start line in the darkness, headtorch on, I felt a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation. I'd trained for months for this moment, but nothing can truly prepare you for what lies ahead in a race like this.</p>

<p>The first few hours were spent climbing through the Italian Alps in the dark, a snake of headtorches winding up into the mountains. The pace was conservative - everyone knew the real challenges lay ahead.</p>

<h2>Into the Mountains</h2>

<p>As dawn broke, I found myself high in the mountains, surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery I've ever seen. Snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows, and distant glaciers stretched out in every direction. It was breathtaking, and for a moment I forgot about my tired legs and just took it all in.</p>

<p>The technical sections came thick and fast - rocky scrambles, steep descents, and narrow trails that demanded complete concentration. This wasn't a race where you could switch off and just grind out miles. Every step required attention.</p>

<h2>The Dark Hours</h2>

<p>By the second night, things got tough. The accumulated fatigue, the sleep deprivation, and the relentless terrain all took their toll. There were moments when I questioned why I was doing this, moments when every step felt like a monumental effort.</p>

<p>But I kept moving forward. One foot in front of the other. That's all you can do in a race like this.</p>

<h2>The Finish</h2>

<p>Crossing the finish line in Chamonix after 30+ hours of running was an indescribable feeling. A mixture of relief, pride, and overwhelming emotion. I'd done it. I'd followed in the footsteps of the Dukes of Savoy and completed one of the most challenging races in the world.</p>

<p>Would I do it again? Absolutely. The TDS is a race that stays with you, a race that changes you. It showed me what I'm capable of when I push beyond my limits, and gave me memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Yesterday was rather a crazy running day. After taking Elsa and Ellis to their swimming lesson early in the morning, I rushed home and set off to Chichester to tackle the Chichester 10k race.</p>

<p>I had run this race a few times before and it's pretty flat so a good opportunity for a fast time. The weather was cold but crisp - perfect running conditions.</p>

<h2>The Race</h2>

<p>The course takes you through the streets of Chichester and out into the surrounding countryside before looping back to finish in the city centre. It's well organised with good crowd support, especially around the start/finish area.</p>

<p>I went off at a good pace and tried to settle into a rhythm. The first few kilometres felt comfortable and I was hitting the splits I wanted. Around the halfway point I started to feel the effort but managed to maintain my pace.</p>

<p>The final couple of kilometres were tough as always, but I dug in and pushed through to the finish line.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p>I crossed the line in a time I was happy with, considering my recent training had been a bit disrupted. It's always good to get a race under your belt and this was a solid performance.</p>

<p>After the race, I rushed back home to pick up the kids from their grandparents and take them to a birthday party. Never a dull moment!</p>

<p>Next up is more training for the Paris Marathon. The race is getting closer and I need to stay focused on my goal.</p>
