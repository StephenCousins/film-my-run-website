<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6th December 2020 | <strong>Distance:</strong> 26.2 miles (42.4km on GPS) | <strong>Time:</strong> 2:58:57 | <strong>Position:</strong> 46th</p>

<p>I ran my first marathon in April 2012. I was 42 years old. Until then I'd been a casual runner - of course I ran at school and occasionally went jogging on the sea front near my home, but I'd not entered a race or done any serious training until 2010 when I entered my first 10k race.</p>

<p>A half marathon followed and before I knew it I was on the slippery slope. Over the next eight years I started to do trail marathons, I joined a running club, then I started to do long distance ultra races. My marathon time gradually improved from around 3:30 average to 3:15, and eventually in 2016 I ran the London Marathon in 3:09.</p>

<p>And then, in December 2020, I finally did it: <strong>2:58:57</strong>. My first sub-3 marathon.</p>

<h2>The Long Road to Sub-3</h2>

<p>Training to achieve a sub-three marathon takes years. Okay, there are some people who are gifted or genetically primed and can run under three hours with minimal training or preparation. But for the rest of us, it starts when you first start running. Once you step out of the door to run your first mile - that's when you start training for a sub-three marathon.</p>

<p>Initially it's about building a strong aerobic base and conditioning your body. New runners will often suffer niggle after niggle as their bodies adapt to regular running. It can take many years of consistent running to get to a stage where you rarely get injured, where you can get up in the morning and run 10 miles without breaking a sweat, and run a half marathon without drinking any water.</p>

<p>Once you've got that base fitness, the next step is volume - gradually increasing the number of miles you run each week. And again, this can take years. I was running about 40 miles a week for quite a few years before I upped my game and started running a consistent 62 miles or 100 kilometres a week. And if you want to break three hours for a marathon, that's the kind of mileage you need to be looking at.</p>

<h2>The Training Block</h2>

<p>In the six months prior to my sub-three marathon, I ran at least 100 kilometres a week and had some weeks at 130 kilometres, some weeks of 140 kilometres, and one week of 150 kilometres.</p>

<p>I adopted an 80/20 strategy whereby 80 percent of your sessions are at a very slow pace. This enabled me to achieve large volumes but without getting over-fatigued or injured. But I also included 20% of hard efforts - either on the treadmill or outdoors. I did high intensity interval sessions or short sharp 5k time trials where I'd make sure my heart rate reached zones four and zone five if I could, at least some of the time.</p>

<p>I tried to stay clear of that comfortable zone 3 void. It's unavoidable that you spend some time in that zone, but I'd never plan a session to be a zone 3 session.</p>

<p>No one is going to hand you a sub-3 marathon on a plate. You need to work for it. In all likelihood you should be running an 18:35 5k (absolutely shattered), or a 38 minute 10k, or a 1 hour 25 half marathon to be within the ballpark of being able to achieve a sub-three marathon.</p>

<h2>The Taper</h2>

<p>Two weeks before the marathon I reduced my mileage from 130 kilometres down to 100 kilometres, and then in the week of the marathon I did about 30 kilometres before the race. So that whole week including the marathon was about 70-odd kilometres of running.</p>

<h2>Nutrition Strategy</h2>

<p>In the weeks prior to the marathon I ate a normal diet. I do tend to be flexitarian - so hardly any red meat but perhaps some chicken occasionally. I do find it hard to resist the cookies and milk though.</p>

<p>Seven days before the marathon I did a three-day carb depletion, so I ate very minimal carbohydrates for 72 hours and then went back on the carbs with a slightly higher ratio of carbs to fats and proteins. I wouldn't call it carb loading - I don't really do carb loading. It's just a slightly altered ratio of macronutrients, so slightly more carbs than proteins and fats. In normal circumstances I would just eat a balanced diet, eat bread and desserts, and just get all fat and sassy.</p>

<p>Race day breakfast was a tin of rice pudding and a couple of cups of coffee. Rice pudding sits easily on my stomach and it's a great source of slow release complex carbohydrates.</p>

<h2>Fat Adaptation</h2>

<p>During the race itself I ate one half of a banana at 20 miles and drank one small bottle of Purdy's fizzy fruit drink - but it could quite easily have been a can of Coke or Red Bull. Basically a bit of slow release complex carbohydrates in the banana and a hit of high GI simple sugar from the fizzy drink. That's it.</p>

<p>It was a cold day and I didn't lose very much fluid as sweat so I didn't drink anything else for the duration of the run. So just to be clear on this: <strong>I didn't drink or eat anything during the marathon for 20 miles.</strong></p>

<p>You may have heard the term "fat adapted". If you're looking to run long distances, you might want to look into running some of your training runs on empty. You don't need to take lots of food with you - don't take any food with you, especially if it's not a long run. Anything around 10 to 20 kilometres, you don't need any food at all. I often just go out with just a cup of coffee inside me, no breakfast.</p>

<p>What I think is that this teaches your body to burn fat more efficiently, which means you need to use fewer gels or sugary drinks in order to give yourself energy to run. That may not work for you, but a lot of the gastric problems in ultra running and long distance running are caused by too much sugar intake - overload of Coke or gels. If you can cut down on that, then all the better.</p>

<h2>The Kit</h2>

<p>Because it was so cold at the start of the race, I did wear a light Montane fleece over my race singlet. I did three laps in that which is about 10 kilometres, and then I threw it to the side of the road. I kept a thin light pair of gloves on and a cap for the whole race.</p>

<p>I wear compression shorts - not for any medical or physiological reason per se, but simply I find them more comfortable than regular shorts. My compression shorts are from a Spanish company called Hanker. I also wore Kalenji seamless running underwear to help prevent chafing, but I didn't have any anti-chafe cream on.</p>

<p>On my feet I wore Injinji toe socks - these are the same ones I tend to wear for my 24-hour 100-mile adventures. Very comfortable and no blisters. I also wore the Nike VaporFlys - these are carbon plated shoes, they're legal, and they help you go faster. So why not wear them? I only wear them for races and never in training.</p>

<p>My current watch is a Garmin Fenix 6X Sapphire. It's what I use for most of my training and races. It's quite big and bulky and it's probably overkill for a flat road marathon.</p>

<h2>Pacing Strategy</h2>

<p>When it comes to pacing I am a huge fan of even splits and negative splits. So I would try to run most of my kilometres at exactly the same pace and then speed up at the end if I had anything left.</p>

<p>On the main screen I had average pace in kilometres per hour and lap pace in minutes per kilometre. I'm a regular treadmill runner so I'm quite used to seeing my speed displayed in kilometres per hour.</p>

<p>For a sub-3 marathon you need to run <strong>14.1 kilometres per hour</strong>, or <strong>4 minutes 16 per kilometre</strong>, or <strong>6:50 per mile</strong>. Ideally a little faster than that to account for any extra distance you might accrue by not sticking to the exact racing line. Obviously in a race you may well be weaving around people - that is adding distance. So crossing the line at 42.2 kilometres is highly unlikely. It's much more likely to be a little bit more than that.</p>

<p>Lap pace was difficult to keep constant because it was quite windy on one side of the track but calm on the other side. So some kilometres were slow into the wind whilst others were fast with the wind behind me or still.</p>

<h2>Confidence Going In</h2>

<p>Prior to the race I'd looked at various online race predictors and they all told me that I was right on the cusp of a sub-three marathon. Some said just over three hours, some said just under three hours, but all of them with a margin of error.</p>

<p>And unlike many of my other marathons - and I've now done 120 of them - it was not a case of fingers crossed and hope I have a good day. This was a matter of running as I knew I could, running as I knew I should, and executing a plan that I was perfectly capable of doing.</p>

<p>I had run an 18:35 5k in a race just a few weeks before. I'd also done a test half marathon where I ran really comfortably at one and a half hours for a half marathon, keeping my heart rate low. So I knew I could get at least there. All I had to do was concentrate, focus, and carry out the plan.</p>

<h2>Race Day at Goodwood</h2>

<p><em>"Right, it's PB day here at Goodwood. We are going for a sub-three marathon. I'm nervous. It's freezing cold. It's been a stressful morning, but hopefully we're gonna get it done."</em></p>

<p>The Goodwood Marathon is run on a loop circuit of about 4 kilometres around the famous Goodwood Motor Circuit. You do 11 laps. It's flat, it's fast, and it's brutally exposed to the wind.</p>

<p>The conditions were tough - freezing cold with a biting wind on one side of the circuit. About two and a half kilometres of every lap was running straight into that wind. Even on what would be considered a mild day, you're into a wind because it's quite exposed. So you're kind of dreading that two and a half k every lap.</p>

<h2>The Finish</h2>

<p>I crossed the line in <strong>two hours, 58 minutes, 57 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>On my watch the distance was 42.4 kilometres - so an extra 200 metres run. I did have to sprint the last little bit just to make sure I got in under three hours.</p>

<p><em>"Right Richard, how was that for you?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Cold! And I think I probably matched my PB, so I'm pretty happy. 3:03. It was just disgusting into that wind, wasn't it?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Yeah, I really dread that little bend - but it's quite a big bend. The loop is about 4k long and two, two and a half kilometres of it is into a wind. So you're kind of dreading that two and a half k every lap. And it's like 11 laps."</em></p>

<p><em>"Still, 3:03 for Richard and my first ever sub-three: 2:58:59-ish, something like that. I can now retire. I never have to run another marathon ever again... and I do. No."</em></p>

<h2>The Journey Complete</h2>

<p>So that's it from the Goodwood Marathon. We're off home. It's very, very cold here - you don't realise how cold it is until you stop running. But we've had a fantastic day. First time ever under three hours for a marathon. So happy with that.</p>

<p>And that's it. That's how I achieved my sub-three marathon. After eight years of running marathons, I'm finally there. And now I think I'd be disappointed if I didn't get close to a sub-three road marathon every time.</p>

  '11202': `
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 9th July 2021 | <strong>Distance:</strong> 100 miles (162.9km) | <strong>Elevation:</strong> 10,198m | <strong>Time:</strong> 46:50:32 | <strong>Position:</strong> 428th of 941 finishers</p>

<p>That was the hardest race I have ever, ever done.</p>

<p>I've said those words before, and I'll probably say them again. But standing in the finish area in Vielha, having just spent nearly 47 hours traversing the Spanish Pyrenees, I meant it more than I'd ever meant anything. This was a different level of suffering.</p>

<h2>Before the Start</h2>

<p>The Val d'Aran 100 was the inaugural running of this race - a brand new addition to the UTMB World Series. In true UTMB style, the start/finish line was set up right next to a quaint little village church in Vielha. Everything was compacted into a few metres - registration, bib collection, the information point, and the presentation area all within touching distance of each other.</p>

<p>What made this race particularly special was the prize for finishing: automatic entry to the UTMB 100 in Chamonix. No ballot, no lottery, no hoping your name gets pulled out. Just finish this beast of a race and you're in. That carrot was dangling in front of me for the next two days.</p>

<p>An hour and twenty minutes before the start, I handed in my drop bag - the one I'd pick up at around 100km. Spare kit, food, things I might need for the second half. It was really, really hot, and I was very nervous. Really nervous, I have to say.</p>

<p>100 miles. 10,000 metres of ascent. 48 hours to do it. The numbers alone were intimidating enough.</p>

<h2>The Inevitable UTMB Bottleneck</h2>

<p>If you've ever done a UTMB race anywhere in the world, you'll know what happens next. We're only four and a half kilometres in, and there are so many people that we've basically come to a complete standstill. Nearly a thousand runners all trying to filter through narrow mountain trails. It happens at every UTMB race, and Val d'Aran was no exception.</p>

<p>But once we got moving again, the views opened up. The first checkpoint came at 11 kilometres - two hours and six minutes in, with 800 metres already climbed. And what a view. At 14 kilometres, standing at the top of the first climb, I could see Aneto - the highest point in mainland Spain - rising up in the distance. Absolutely amazing, especially with the sun still up.</p>

<h2>Into the Night</h2>

<p>By six hours and 37 minutes, I'd reached the third aid station. It was half past midnight, and the station was closing in about 35 minutes - so we weren't too far inside the cutoff. I grabbed some soup and bread, knowing there was a very big, long climb ahead.</p>

<p>The pattern was establishing itself: climb, descend, climb again. At five to three in the morning, I could see the first hints of dawn starting to break. We'd done 38 kilometres in almost nine hours.</p>

<p>By 50 kilometres - nearly 12 hours in - I was well over a quarter of the way there. Almost a third. I didn't feel too bad at that point, just starting to get tired with all these climbs. We'd had some really tough ones, but we were getting there.</p>

<h2>The Quads Start to Go</h2>

<p>At 57 kilometres, I stopped at Bossost for pasta and black coffee. And that's when I noticed it - my quads had got properly trashed on the downhill into the aid station. I'd been there almost half an hour, which was too long really. Thirteen hours and 29 minutes on the clock. Time to get moving.</p>

<p>The next section took us to Canejan at 64 kilometres, and then... the monster climb. The big one. A 1,500-metre ascent up the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>At 17 hours 55 minutes, we began that climb. There was a beautiful blue lake below us, and we were 75 kilometres in. The heat was brutal. Every time we came across a little stream, we were all throwing ourselves under it to keep cool.</p>

<h2>Halfway - 20 Hours In</h2>

<p>Twenty hours and 24 minutes into the Val d'Aran 100, we'd covered 80 kilometres. Halfway. It seemed amazing that it was only halfway, but there we are.</p>

<p>This wasn't really a run anymore. It was more of a long, slow hike. But the scenery was fantastic - mountain passes, glaciers forming streams and waterfalls that tumbled down into the valleys below.</p>

<p>Coming down from one pass, I could look back up and see the V-shape at the top where we'd just descended from. 95 kilometres done, 25 hours and 11 minutes on the clock. And my quads were absolutely shot. Running downhill had become really, really painful. I could manage the flat, I could make my way slowly uphill, but descending was agony. And we still had 65 kilometres to go.</p>

<h2>The Second Night</h2>

<p>As the sun went down for the second time, I made my way to the drop bag station at 103 kilometres. I was very, very tired. Rapidly losing patience with this race. So hard.</p>

<p>I got changed, ate some food, prepared for the night section. Although "prepared" is a strong word - I was absolutely shattered. And the news filtering through the aid station wasn't encouraging: apparently over 300 people had already withdrawn. DNF'd. It was a beast of a race, and it was breaking people.</p>

<p>Looking around, there weren't many runners left. I was going to be on my own on the hills tonight.</p>

<h2>Sunrise, Sickness, and Stubbornness</h2>

<p>The sun came up for the second time and I felt sick. Properly sick. I'd had enough of this race. Still 20 miles to go.</p>

<p>You can't deny it was beautiful though. But having been up for two nights now, stomach feeling funny, feet hurting, legs completely trashed, and the gnarliest course I'd ever seen in my life... I was not feeling it.</p>

<p>Then, like an idiot - as I always do - I failed to look at the information correctly. I thought the aid station I was at was the one with the 12:45 cutoff. It was actually the next one. But we had three hours to get there: a little climb, then 968 metres straight down. My mate Dai reckoned we could do it. I reckoned we could do it too.</p>

<h2>Making the Final Cutoff</h2>

<p>Good news - we made it to the final aid station with a cutoff time, and we made it with an hour to spare. All we needed to do now was eat, figure out how to stay cool for the final section, and get it done. One aid station in the middle, a big climb, a little climb, then downhill into Vielha for the finish.</p>

<p>The final climb was standard fare for the past two days: trudging up a mountain, very slowly, through a forest, eventually coming out into open land with the higher peaks visible in the distance. We'd done this about four times over the course of the race. But this was the last one.</p>

<h2>The Finish</h2>

<p>Three and a half kilometres to go. I could see Vielha down below. But my legs were absolutely rock solid. I could hardly move.</p>

<p><em>"From the United Kingdom, well done Stephen!"</em></p>

<p>What a wonderful feeling, crossing that finish line. 46 hours, 51 minutes.</p>

<p><em>"Ring that bell Stephen, ring that bell! You made it home. Stephen's coming home. Football's coming home."</em></p>

<p>That was the hardest race I have ever, ever done. I'm just so glad to be back home.</p>

<h2>The Aftermath</h2>

<p>Finishing Val d'Aran earned me something I'd been chasing for years: automatic entry to the UTMB 100 in Chamonix. No more lottery, no more hoping. I was in.</p>

<p>Two years later, I'd stand on that start line in Chamonix and complete the full UTMB 100. But that's another story.</p>

<p>For now, standing in Vielha with legs that could barely hold me up, having survived two nights in the Pyrenees, having watched over 300 runners drop out around me, having thrown myself into mountain streams just to cope with the heat - I'd done it.</p>

<p>The hardest race I have ever done. And completely worth it.</p>

  '11291': `
<p>Have you ever considered running without a watch? No, not literally running naked, but leaving your trusty timepiece at home and just enjoying the experience of running without the burden of tracking your pace, heart rate, and other metrics. It may sound crazy, but hear me out.</p>

<p>As runners, we are constantly bombarded with data and numbers. We obsess over our splits, our heart rate zones, and our pacing strategy. It's as if we're wearing a psychological straightjacket that limits our enjoyment of the run. But what if we could break free from this constraint and just run for the pure joy of it?</p>

<p>Recently, I tried running a half marathon without looking at my watch, and it was a liberating experience. Instead of constantly checking my pace, I was able to focus on my surroundings and enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of my experience and why I think every runner should try running without a watch at least once:</p>

<h2>The Straightjacket of a Watch</h2>

<p>We're so used to relying on our watches to dictate our pace and effort level that we forget to listen to our bodies. We train with goal paces in mind and lock into specific paces for different types of runs. We check our heart rate zones to make sure we're in the right zone. We glance down at our watch and adjust our pace accordingly, even if it means deviating from our natural rhythm.</p>

<figure><img src="https://filmmyrun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-09.16.27-1024x349.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>By running without a watch, I was able to break free from this constraint. I had no feedback on how fast or slow I was going, and it was surprisingly liberating. I could focus on my surroundings and enjoy the feeling of running fast without worrying about hitting a specific pace.</p>

<h2>The Mind-Body Connection</h2>

<p>There's a strong connection between our mind and body, and we often forget that they don't function independently. By running without a watch, I was able to reconnect with my body and listen to its cues. I could tell when I was running fast, and I knew when to settle into a comfortable pace.</p>

<figure><img src="https://filmmyrun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-19-at-14.21.37-1024x621.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>I also noticed that my effort level remained consistent throughout the race in terms of heart rate. It gradually rose during the race and spiked towards the end when I could smell the finish line. But overall, I was able to maintain a steady effort level without constantly adjusting my pace based on my watch.</p>

<h2>The Freedom to Run Fast</h2>

<p>When we're tied to our watches, we tend to be more conservative in our pacing strategy. We tell ourselves not to be a hero, not to go off too fast, and to stick to the plan. But by running without a watch, I was able to let go of these constraints and just run fast.</p>

<p>I didn't have to worry about hitting a specific pace, so I could start fast and settle into a comfortable rhythm. I could let go of the fear of going too fast and just enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>So, what were the results of running without looking at my watch? Well, I finished the Surrey Half Marathon in 1 hour 24 minutes and 10 seconds, which was faster than I thought I was going. In fact, the last 10k was faster than my official 10K PB of 39 minutes and 43 seconds.</p>

<figure><img src="https://filmmyrun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-25-at-15.57.02-1-1024x562.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>But more importantly, I enjoyed the experience of running without checking the watch every few seconds! I was able to focus on my surroundings and connect with my body. I was able to let go of the burden of tracking my pace and just enjoy the feeling of running fast.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Running without a watch may sound crazy, but it's an experience that every runner should try at least once. By breaking free from the constraints of tracking our pace, we can reconnect with our bodies and enjoy the pure joy of running. We can let go of the fear of going too fast and just run fast for the sheer pleasure of it.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm not suggesting that you should throw away your watch altogether. Tracking your progress and seeing your improvement over time can be incredibly motivating. But by running without a watch every now and then, you can reconnect with the joy of running and remind yourself why you fell in love with the sport in the first place.</p>

<p>So, the next time you lace up your running shoes, why not leave your watch at home and just enjoy the freedom of running without constraints? Who knows, you may surprise yourself with what you're capable of achieving.</p>

<p>My day began at midnight. The gun went off and hundreds of runners began shuffling towards the start gantry in Courmayeur, Italy. I was about to embark on one of the most challenging and beautiful races of my life - the TDS (Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie), a 145km ultra marathon through the Alps.</p>

<p>The TDS is part of the UTMB festival, and while it may not have the prestige of the main UTMB race, it's considered by many to be the most technical and beautiful of all the races. The route takes you through the wild Beaufortain massif, over countless cols and passes, with a total elevation gain of around 9,100m.</p>

<h2>The Start</h2>

<p>Standing at the start line in the darkness, headtorch on, I felt a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation. I'd trained for months for this moment, but nothing can truly prepare you for what lies ahead in a race like this.</p>

<p>The first few hours were spent climbing through the Italian Alps in the dark, a snake of headtorches winding up into the mountains. The pace was conservative - everyone knew the real challenges lay ahead.</p>

<h2>Into the Mountains</h2>

<p>As dawn broke, I found myself high in the mountains, surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery I've ever seen. Snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows, and distant glaciers stretched out in every direction. It was breathtaking, and for a moment I forgot about my tired legs and just took it all in.</p>

<p>The technical sections came thick and fast - rocky scrambles, steep descents, and narrow trails that demanded complete concentration. This wasn't a race where you could switch off and just grind out miles. Every step required attention.</p>

<h2>The Dark Hours</h2>

<p>By the second night, things got tough. The accumulated fatigue, the sleep deprivation, and the relentless terrain all took their toll. There were moments when I questioned why I was doing this, moments when every step felt like a monumental effort.</p>

<p>But I kept moving forward. One foot in front of the other. That's all you can do in a race like this.</p>

<h2>The Finish</h2>

<p>Crossing the finish line in Chamonix after 30+ hours of running was an indescribable feeling. A mixture of relief, pride, and overwhelming emotion. I'd done it. I'd followed in the footsteps of the Dukes of Savoy and completed one of the most challenging races in the world.</p>

<p>Would I do it again? Absolutely. The TDS is a race that stays with you, a race that changes you. It showed me what I'm capable of when I push beyond my limits, and gave me memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Yesterday was rather a crazy running day. After taking Elsa and Ellis to their swimming lesson early in the morning, I rushed home and set off to Chichester to tackle the Chichester 10k race.</p>

<p>I had run this race a few times before and it's pretty flat so a good opportunity for a fast time. The weather was cold but crisp - perfect running conditions.</p>

<h2>The Race</h2>

<p>The course takes you through the streets of Chichester and out into the surrounding countryside before looping back to finish in the city centre. It's well organised with good crowd support, especially around the start/finish area.</p>

<p>I went off at a good pace and tried to settle into a rhythm. The first few kilometres felt comfortable and I was hitting the splits I wanted. Around the halfway point I started to feel the effort but managed to maintain my pace.</p>

<p>The final couple of kilometres were tough as always, but I dug in and pushed through to the finish line.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p>I crossed the line in a time I was happy with, considering my recent training had been a bit disrupted. It's always good to get a race under your belt and this was a solid performance.</p>

<p>After the race, I rushed back home to pick up the kids from their grandparents and take them to a birthday party. Never a dull moment!</p>

<p>Next up is more training for the Paris Marathon. The race is getting closer and I need to stay focused on my goal.</p>

  '12002': `
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 1st February 2019 | <strong>Distance:</strong> 100 miles | <strong>Time:</strong> 28:31:46 | <strong>Position:</strong> Gold Buckle</p>

<p>The Arc of Attrition has a way of testing you before you've even started. This was my third attempt at one of Britain's most brutal ultramarathons, and the drama began long before the starting gun.</p>

<h2>The Journey Down</h2>

<p>Snow had blanketed the South West overnight. We got caught in a drift on the A38 near Exeter, but escaped the worst of it. Others weren't so lucky - my friend Richard spent the entire night trapped on Bodmin Moor and never made the start line. Of the 192 entries, over 30 runners couldn't even get to Cornwall. The Arc was already living up to its name.</p>

<p>We made it to our hotel in Camborne late evening, grabbed what sleep we could, and drove to registration the following morning at the new race HQ - the Ecological Park in Portreath. Then it was onto the buses bound for Coverack, where 100 miles of Cornish coastline awaited.</p>

<h2>Into the Gnarly</h2>

<p>The Arc doesn't ease you in. From the moment you leave Coverack, you're on technical terrain - rocky, muddy, unforgiving. The first meeting point with my family came at Lizard Point, just over 10 miles in, after two and a half hours of careful running. I was being conservative, preserving energy for what lay ahead.</p>

<p>Through Mullion Cove to Porthleven, then on to the first major checkpoint at Penzance around the 38-mile mark. The flat tarmac through town felt like a gift after the relentless coastal path - a brief respite before the real challenges began.</p>

<h2>Into the Darkness</h2>

<p>Night fell somewhere past Penzance. The checkpoints rolled by - Lamorna Cove, Minack Theatre (that beautiful amphitheatre carved into the cliffs), and finally Land's End around 2am. I'd made good time, slightly ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: my wife wasn't there. She claims she was in the car park. I maintain she wasn't. Either way, I grabbed a quick bowl of chicken soup from the ever-reliable Arc Angels volunteers and pressed on.</p>

<p>Navigation becomes critical after Land's End. The previous year I'd managed to come back on myself through a navigational error. This time I kept my eyes glued to the GPS. The temptation to simply follow the runner ahead is strong, but I've learned that lesson the hard way - follow someone blindly and you'll end up in brambles or fields or worse.</p>

<h2>The Toughest 13 Miles in Britain</h2>

<p>My head torch died somewhere between Sennen Cove and Cape Cornwall. In pitch darkness, fumbling with batteries, I eventually got it working again and made it to Cape Cornwall around 4am. Victoria cleaned my feet, changed my socks, and I tried not to notice how tired I'd become. I was confusing place names, mixing up Land's End with St Ives. Mental focus was slipping.</p>

<p>What came next was the crux of the race: 13 miles from Pendeen Watch lighthouse to St Ives, with no crew support in between. This stretch of coastline is, without exaggeration, the most technical terrain you'll find anywhere in the UK. Boulders to scramble over, paths that disappear, cliff edges lurking in the darkness.</p>

<p>And then the weather turned biblical.</p>

<p>The wind had been howling all night, but now came sideways hailstones - not tiny specks, but marble-sized ice projectiles hammering into my face. For fifteen minutes at a stretch, then a brief respite, then another barrage. All while picking my way over rocky, muddy, slippery terrain in the dark.</p>

<h2>The Navigation Error</h2>

<p>Fatigue does strange things to your brain. As dawn began to break, I realised I'd drifted off the coast path. Rather than backtracking - the sensible option - I convinced myself there must be a route back to the coast if I just kept going. There wasn't. I ended up in the village of Zennor, asking a stranger in a car park how to find the coast path again.</p>

<p>Half an hour and two extra miles added to my journey. Frustrating at the time, but that's the Arc - it's a self-navigation event, and when you're exhausted, mistakes happen. At least this time the blame was entirely my own.</p>

<h2>The Final Push</h2>

<p>St Ives arrived at 10:30am, 22.5 hours into the race. The Arc Angels volunteers welcomed me in, and I knew the worst was behind me. From here it was flatter, easier running around the bay through Hayle, across the dunes, past Godrevy lighthouse to the final checkpoint at Portreath.</p>

<p>I was shattered. The pace from St Ives onwards had been slower than I'd wanted, and I was disappointed in myself. But I still had a shot at a PB if I could find something for the final miles.</p>

<p>The finish had moved since my previous attempts - no longer at the Blue Bar on the beach, but down a hill, out of Portreath, and up another hill to the Eco Park. An extra mile when you've already done 100.</p>

<h2>The Tears</h2>

<p>I crossed the line in 28 hours, 31 minutes and 46 seconds. A personal best. A gold buckle (awarded for finishing under 30 hours).</p>

<p>And I cried.</p>

<p>Not everyone will understand those tears. But anyone who's pushed themselves through 100 miles - through darkness and hailstones and navigational errors and sheer physical exhaustion - will recognise what they mean. It's relief that you've crossed the line without injury, without having to pull out, without falling off a cliff. It's gratitude that your body held together. It's pride and satisfaction and an outpouring of emotion that doesn't come often in life.</p>

<p>I don't cry at every finish line. But I cry at the ones that have really put me through the wringer, the ones that have demanded everything. The Arc is one of those races.</p>

<h2>The Morning After</h2>

<p>The prize-giving the next day celebrated Kim Collison's stunning course record of 20 hours 43 minutes. Extraordinary running. For the rest of us, the achievement was simply finishing - earning that gold buckle, completing one of Britain's most unforgiving ultramarathons.</p>

<p>The Arc of Attrition isn't just a race. It's an adventure. It's a test of navigation and mental fortitude as much as physical endurance. It will humble you, frustrate you, and push you to places you didn't know you could go.</p>

<p>If you have even the slightest inkling that you might like to try it, sign up. You won't regret it.</p>
