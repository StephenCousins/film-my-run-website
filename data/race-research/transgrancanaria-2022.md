## Race Overview
- 126km with approximately 7000m of ascent and descent
- 30-hour cut-off
- Zig-zags across Gran Canaria from north to south
- Part of the UTMB World Series

## 2022 Weather - The Storm
- Expected: Nice dry warm race in the sun
- Reality: "A sudden change in weather pattern turned it more like a bad day in Scotland"
- Hours before start: Email from organisers warning of "probable rain and mud, but above all be prepared for strong winds in the mountains"
- Race day: Woke up to rain
- Last-minute email suggesting windproof trousers

### Conditions During Race
- Wild weather in first 30km
- Gusts of wind "almost blew me over a couple of times" (Abelone Lyng)
- MUD - and believe it or not, SNOW
- Rain and wind came back hard on the long exposed ascent to Artenara (CP5)
- Rain turned to sleet at times
- Many runners withdrew at Artenara (65km) - highest village in Gran Canaria at 1200m
- No sign of weather improvement, meaning 3-4 hours more exposure before next checkpoint
- Second half: cloudless skies and scorching sun
