---

## Race Overview
- 100 miles along the South West Coast Path, Cornwall
- Winter race (late January/early February)
- 4010m total elevation
- Renowned as "The UK's toughest winter 100 mile ultra footrace"
- Average finish rate: less than 50% (brutal conditions and tight time limits)

## 2019 Conditions
- Snow on the ground disappeared as runners approached the South coast
- First 25 miles to Porthleven: good running, a bit muddy, chilly and windy but sun was out
- Sunset over the sea was spectacular - "Cornwall looked absolutely stunning"
- By 2am: "very dark, cold and windy" on the remote coast path

## The Notorious Pendeen to St Ives Section
- 13 miles of the toughest terrain on the course
- Wild and rugged, no road access
- Elite runners: 3 miles/hour; realistic pace: 2 miles/hour
- "Expect to be hit by the full force of wind/rain/hail/sleet/snow"
- No shelter for the majority of this section
- Organisers recommend traversing with other runners for safety

## Course Character
- Primary challenge is weather, not terrain
- Winter race on the coast = infamously windy, wet and cold
- Land's End to Pendeen Watch: "a little lumpy but not too bad"
- Then Pendeen to St Ives: the hardest section

## Context for Stephen
- February 100-miler on the Cornish coast in winter
- 28:31:46 finish time
