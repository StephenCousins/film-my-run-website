## Event Overview
The twelfth edition of the Autumn 100, with a record field of 259 runners gathered at the Thames Path start.

## Weather & Conditions
Ideal running conditions emerged after warmer weather earlier in the week dropped to temperatures around 12°C on race day. Overnight temperatures plummeted to 3°C on the Ridgeway with wind gusts, creating challenging conditions that eliminated many competitors. However, "a clear star filled sky" provided consolation for those who persevered through the night.

## Men's Race
Geoff Cheshire set a new course record of 13:58:47—impressively, just 30 seconds under the previous mark despite the course running one mile longer due to a diversion on Leg One. Cheshire led throughout the entire race, gradually extending his advantage. Rob Forbes finished second in 14:38, while Justin Montague claimed third in 15:47.

## Women's Race
The competitive women's race featured Sarah Page leading early, but Ruth Hawkins ultimately won her 100-mile debut in 19:16. Sarah Page finished second in 19:34, narrowly edging Rachel Stanley-Evans at 19:37.

## Notable Achievement
Ken Fancett, age 74, completed his 100th lifetime 100-mile race finish, along with his 42nd Centurion 100 and tenth Grand Slam. He continues racing into 2024.

## Results
182 runners finished (70% completion rate), with 97 breaking the 24-hour barrier for the buckle.
