## Event Overview
The 12th running of the South Downs Way 100, starting from Matterley Bowl, Winchester at 6am. 192 of 339 starters finished (57% finish rate).

## Weather & Conditions
The event featured dramatically contrasting conditions. Early morning brought bright sunshine that intensified rapidly, creating fierce heat throughout Saturday that "derailed more attempts to finish than we've ever seen here before." Once the sun set, conditions improved significantly, and dropout rates plummeted among those who persevered into evening.

This race produced "the lowest finish rate we've ever had at the SDW100" and ranked among the top ten lowest completion rates across Centurion's 52 ultramarathon events since 2011.

## Women's Race
Sarah Page won in 20:31:56 (including a one-hour mandatory kit penalty), describing it as "a superb debut 100." Cat Simpson finished second in 20:40, with Aoife Ni Mhaoileoin taking third in 22:07. Page initially crossed first but received the penalty for missing mandatory equipment.

## Men's Race
Tim Bradley dominated with a "extremely well executed race" winning in 15:50. He maintained consistent pacing throughout. Henrik Westerlin finished second in 17:09, while Alan Clarke secured third place, advancing from 18th at the first checkpoint within the final 15 miles.

## Notes
Nearly 120 volunteers supported the event.
