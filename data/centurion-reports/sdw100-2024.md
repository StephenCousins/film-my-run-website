## Event Overview
The South Downs Way 100 took place on June 11, 2024, at Matterley Bowl near Winchester. This marked the event's inaugural year as part of the Gran Canaria World Trail Majors series, featuring a record-breaking 81.1% finish rate—the highest among all 56 100-mile races organized by Centurion Running to date.

## Course & Conditions
The 100-mile trail follows a historic route through the South Downs that has existed for thousands of years. The race began at 0600 on Saturday morning in "near perfect running conditions" with excellent visibility and overnight weather that runners described as magical.

## Women's Race
**Winner: Cat Simpson (19:26)**

Sophie Bennett initially led through the early miles before Justine Putnam took charge. Simpson, a Centurion Ultra Team member, gradually built a commanding lead despite losing her gels at a checkpoint. She eventually extended her advantage to over an hour. Karen Benway, a highly experienced runner and Quebec Mega Trail podium finisher, demonstrated strategic pacing and moved into second place late in the race, finishing in 20:18. Hannah Green claimed third in 20:25.

## Men's Race
**Winner: Dan Lawson (14:27:30)**

The men's race started explosively with Geoff Cheshire running near-record pace, but he developed cramp and withdrew. Rob Payne took the lead briefly before Pete Windross surged ahead with aggressive pacing. However, Dan Lawson's measured, consistent approach proved superior. "The highest performing runner over longer ultras that we have seen in the past decade here in the UK," Lawson used his competitive experience to move into the lead during the final quarter. His winning time represented the second-fastest finish in race history. Hugh Tibbs (14:46) and Pete Windross (14:48) rounded out the podium.

## Notable Achievements
- Ken Fancett earned his 1000-mile buckle, marking his tenth finish here and 103rd 100-mile completion overall
- David Prince-Iles set a new MV70 age group record with a 20:14 finish
