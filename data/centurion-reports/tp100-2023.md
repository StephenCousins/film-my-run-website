## Event Overview
The twelfth edition of the Thames Path 100, starting from Richmond Old Town Hall and finishing in Oxford—a 100-mile journey along the Thames.

## Race Conditions
Participants encountered challenging weather from the start. "A light drizzle that rapidly became steady rain which would persist well into the evening" greeted runners at the beginning. The muddy conditions intensified significantly as the route progressed through flood plains, meadows, and single-track trails.

## Course Highlights
The early miles featured fast-paced running over paved sections and all-terrain paths. However, the course deteriorated considerably in the latter stages, with one or two areas described as featuring "epic" mud that severely tested finishers.

## Performance & Attrition
A record field started the race, yet conditions took their toll. The first dropout didn't occur until 5 hours 36 minutes in—remarkably resilient. However, between miles 51 and 89, organizers "lost a further 117 runners." Only 207 runners finished of approximately 340 starters, yielding a 61% completion rate.

## Women's Race
Line Caliskaner from Norway dominated throughout, winning in 17:02. She maintained her lead despite a navigation error resulting in a 15-minute time credit. Becky Atkinson finished second in 18:02, with Sharon Walker third in 19:11.

## Men's Race
Geoff Cheshire claimed victory in 14:18, described as "a truly remarkable run" given conditions. Matt Field placed second (14:52 with time credit), followed by Paul Maskell in third (15:07).

## Notable Achievements
Ninety-six runners achieved the 100-mile buckle within 24 hours, while five runners earned their 500-mile club buckle during this event. Kenneth Fancett recorded his 96th 100-mile finish.
