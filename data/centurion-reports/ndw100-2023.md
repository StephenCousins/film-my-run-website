## Event Overview
The 13th annual North Downs Way 100.

## Race Conditions
The event faced significant weather challenges from Storm Antoni during registration. Despite harsh conditions and over 30 hours of racing, 70% of starters finished—a record completion rate for the event.

## Women's Race
Charlotte Fisher dominated the women's competition from start to finish. Remarkably, "Charlotte only began running seriously around a year ago" and was competing in her first 100-miler. She built a commanding lead, finishing in 22:38. Rachel Gillings mounted an impressive comeback, advancing from 10th at the first checkpoint to claim second place in 23:00, finishing just 22 minutes behind. Lydia Thomson secured third (23:06) after starting 15th at the opening checkpoint.

## Men's Race
The men's competition was exceptionally tight, featuring several debuts at Centurion events. Ryan Whelan, Joe Ackerley, and Mason Willis traded the lead multiple times throughout the race. In a dramatic finish, Ryan overtook Joe with just 2km remaining, winning by 300 meters—"the incredible sight we were presented at the finish, was Joe hitting the track as Ryan rounded the final bend." Ryan's winning time was 17:07:20, with Joe finishing 87 seconds behind.

## Notable Achievements
Ken Fancett, competing in his 99th 100-miler, won the MV70 age group category.
